**Bellman's Equation**
=====================

Bellman's Equation is a mathematical formula used in Reinforcement Learning to compute the optimal value of a policy (policy) in an environment. The equation was first developed by Richard Bellman in 1957.

**Bellman's Equation**
---------------------

Bellman's Equation can be written as:

V(s) = max[ r + γ V(s') ]

where:

* `V(s)` is the optimal value of the policy in state `s`
* `r` is the reward received in state `s`
* `γ` is the discount factor, which represents the weight of future rewards
* `s'` is the next state after taking action `a` in state `s`

**Interpretation**
-----------------

Bellman's Equation represents the process of finding the optimal value of a policy in an environment. The equation shows that the optimal value of a policy in state `s` is computed by adding the reward received in state `s` to the optimal value of the policy in the next state `s'`, and multiplying it by the discount factor `γ`.

**Example**
-----------

Let's consider a simple environment with two states: `s1` and `s2`, and two actions: `a1` and `a2`. We want to find the optimal value of the policy at state `s1`.

Bellman's Equation would be written as:

V(s1) = max[ r1 + γ V(s2), r2 + γ V(s1) ]

In this case, we need to compute the optimal value of the policy at state `s1` by comparing the values of two possible policies: one that takes action `a1` in state `s2`, and another that takes action `a2` in state `s1`.

**Using Bellman's Equation**
---------------------------

Bellman's Equation is widely used in Reinforcement Learning to find the optimal value of a policy in an environment. It can be used to solve problems such as:

* Finding the optimal policy in a specific environment
* Evaluating the performance of a policy in an environment
* Discovering new policies by computing their optimal values

However, Bellman's Equation also has some limitations, such as:

* Not being able to handle environments with many states or actions
* Requiring specialized techniques to handle identical cases

In summary, Bellman's Equation is a fundamental formula in Reinforcement Learning that helps us find the optimal value of a policy in an environment.
