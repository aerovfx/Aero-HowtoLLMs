00:01.720 --> 00:08.800
In this video, I will show you how to make your graphs look nicer by adding labels and titles and so

00:08.800 --> 00:09.640
on to them.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.680
So let me start by creating a new variable x.

00:12.680 --> 00:20.520
This is going to be linearly spaced numbers from minus three to plus 3 in 101 steps and y 101.

00:20.520 --> 00:24.760
Well it gives us one number per Dalmatian if you get that reference.

00:25.040 --> 00:25.320
Okay.

00:25.320 --> 00:25.880
Let's see.

00:25.920 --> 00:32.240
Uh plt dot plot x by x and let's call this y equals x.

00:32.760 --> 00:39.720
And then I'm going to actually just copy and paste paste paste I want to draw x squared.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.040
And here I want to draw x cubed.

00:42.320 --> 00:50.080
And now I also need to update the legend and plt dot legend plt dot show.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.000
Okay.

00:51.360 --> 00:51.840
Very nice.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.840
Now you know this plot doesn't look so bad.

00:53.880 --> 00:58.600
But there's a couple of ways that we can improve how this plot looks.

00:58.600 --> 01:04.730
For one thing, it has no labels and it's nice to have labels in your axes.

01:04.730 --> 01:09.930
So I'm going to add a new function here plt dot x label.

01:10.290 --> 01:14.450
And well you know we don't actually you know it's just made up data.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.450
So we don't know where this comes from.

01:16.450 --> 01:18.650
So I'm going to call this x okay.

01:18.690 --> 01:20.490
So rerun this code.

01:20.490 --> 01:23.130
And now we see a little x appeared over here.

01:23.330 --> 01:26.450
And I'm going to copy and paste change the x to y.

01:27.010 --> 01:32.370
And let's say y equals f of x okay.

01:32.410 --> 01:36.170
So now on the y axis we see y equals f of x.

01:36.650 --> 01:42.250
If you are familiar with LaTeX coding then you can also add dollar signs.

01:42.370 --> 01:46.970
And that is going to print this information in LaTeX.

01:47.290 --> 01:50.690
Now the only change you see here is that it becomes italicized.

01:50.690 --> 01:53.290
But we can this will look better here.

01:53.290 --> 01:56.970
So I'm going to put this into dollar signs.

01:56.970 --> 01:58.890
And now I can use the caret symbol.

01:58.890 --> 02:03.130
This is for the superscripting in LaTeX.

02:03.130 --> 02:04.610
So now we see the label.

02:04.610 --> 02:08.690
Here we have y equals x x star star two.

02:08.930 --> 02:10.810
And here we have y equals.

02:10.810 --> 02:13.930
And you see some more spacing here around the equal sign.

02:13.930 --> 02:15.570
And then you have the three in.

02:15.610 --> 02:19.250
Let me zoom in here just to make sure that that's really crisply clear.

02:19.570 --> 02:19.890
Okay.

02:19.930 --> 02:20.570
So there you go.

02:20.570 --> 02:24.090
Now we see a nice stylized X cubed here.

02:24.730 --> 02:25.250
All right.

02:25.290 --> 02:26.930
So this is one thing we can do.

02:27.370 --> 02:31.170
We can also add a title PLT dot title.

02:31.170 --> 02:36.490
And this is going to be called a really awesome plot with an exclamation point.

02:36.490 --> 02:43.930
So you know that I'm serious I don't really like the whitespace here at the end of the plot and at the

02:43.930 --> 02:45.490
beginning of the plot.

02:45.890 --> 02:50.410
And that's because in theory, these functions can keep going on indefinitely.

02:50.410 --> 02:54.610
So what I would like to do is set the x limit.

02:54.610 --> 03:04.060
So the limit for visualization of the x axis, and I'm going to set that to go from minus three to plus

03:04.060 --> 03:04.380
three.

03:04.420 --> 03:10.580
And notice that I'm actually only providing a single input into this x limb function.

03:10.740 --> 03:16.660
So I'm not providing two inputs corresponding to the lower bound and the upper bound.

03:16.780 --> 03:20.580
Instead this is just one input and it's a list.

03:20.780 --> 03:25.100
And it corresponds to the lower edge and the upper edge.

03:25.100 --> 03:28.540
And actually maybe I'll set this to be one just for demonstration.

03:28.900 --> 03:34.380
So now you see we the plot starts at minus three and it only goes up to one.

03:34.540 --> 03:34.780
Okay.

03:34.820 --> 03:36.500
So I'll change that to three.

03:37.140 --> 03:42.780
But now look what happens if I change this x variable up here.

03:42.780 --> 03:44.700
If I only define this up to two.

03:45.060 --> 03:46.820
Now we get even more white space.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.220
And this is kind of awkward.

03:48.940 --> 03:55.980
So what I'm going to do is instead of hard coding this here, I'm going to soft code this to be the

03:56.020 --> 04:01.150
first element in X and then the last element in x.

04:01.310 --> 04:09.430
So now the x axis limits will adjust automatically according to whatever I specify up here.

04:09.470 --> 04:12.910
So now I can go back to minus three to plus three.

04:13.070 --> 04:17.150
And then you see that that changes in the plot okay.

04:17.190 --> 04:21.270
And then yeah for the there's also of course setting the y limit.

04:21.470 --> 04:27.550
And here you can also make this be dynamic according to the values in the function.

04:27.550 --> 04:32.030
But I will just write minus ten to plus ten okay.

04:32.110 --> 04:37.110
So that does clip off a little bit of the x cubed function here.

04:37.110 --> 04:37.870
But that's okay.

04:38.270 --> 04:38.670
All right.

04:38.710 --> 04:42.390
So not so bad I hope you see the pattern here of how it works.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.270
Um and the syntax.

04:44.430 --> 04:50.710
Now this is a lot to write down, especially because you might have even more of these.

04:50.950 --> 04:53.310
Uh stylizations to implement.

04:53.310 --> 04:57.550
So what I'm going to do now is copy all of this code.

04:58.070 --> 04:59.430
Paste it down here.

04:59.430 --> 05:00.910
I guess we don't need this.

05:01.790 --> 05:02.790
Paste it down here.

05:02.830 --> 05:04.110
Actually I will add something.

05:04.110 --> 05:10.910
I'm going to write plt dot figure figsize equals ten by three.

05:11.230 --> 05:16.550
Okay, so now I am explicitly creating a figure and setting its figure size.

05:16.590 --> 05:21.990
Notice the size of this figure compared to the default size of this figure.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.790
There's no right or wrong here.

05:23.790 --> 05:30.390
This is just about preferences, personal preferences and what you are trying to illustrate in the plot.

05:30.870 --> 05:31.190
Okay.

05:31.230 --> 05:34.670
And now notice also we don't need any outputs.

05:34.670 --> 05:35.990
In theory this gives an output.

05:35.990 --> 05:38.150
But we don't need to use that here okay.

05:38.190 --> 05:46.750
What I want to do is basically replace these five lines of code with one call to one function.

05:46.990 --> 05:53.190
So I'm going to write plt dot g okay.

05:53.390 --> 05:59.680
So plt for plot the GCA stands for get current axis.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.600
So get current axis.

06:02.600 --> 06:09.640
That is GCA, and the current axis is the axis that you are currently drawing to.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.040
So that's this axis.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.960
It's the only axis that we have here.

06:13.440 --> 06:13.720
Okay.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.800
And then set for setting various parameters.

06:16.800 --> 06:21.120
So now I can write x label equals x like this.

06:21.120 --> 06:28.000
Notice it's kind of the same as this call to x label here but slightly different because here this is

06:28.000 --> 06:28.680
a function.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.960
So I have parentheses here.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.320
This is a parameter.

06:32.320 --> 06:37.760
So I set an equals sign and then y label equals.

06:37.800 --> 06:42.640
And now let me see I'm just going to get rid of all this stuff.

06:42.640 --> 06:49.760
So y equals this and then title equals this.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.920
And let's see x.

06:55.130 --> 06:57.010
Equals this list.

06:57.010 --> 07:03.130
And finally we have y equals this list.

07:03.490 --> 07:03.850
Okay.

07:03.890 --> 07:07.690
So now this is one line of code and it achieves the same result.

07:07.730 --> 07:10.410
Now this is a really long line of code.

07:10.850 --> 07:12.770
In theory there's nothing wrong with this.

07:12.770 --> 07:19.850
But when you have a really long line of code with lots of inputs, it's generally a good idea to incorporate

07:19.850 --> 07:25.450
some spaces into this so that it's just a little bit easier to read.

07:25.770 --> 07:27.330
So here I.

07:27.530 --> 07:34.330
Now you can do this for each optional input, but I am organizing these to have the labels.

07:34.450 --> 07:36.170
Here is the title.

07:36.170 --> 07:38.570
And here are the axis limits.

07:38.770 --> 07:40.730
And we can even add some comments in here.

07:40.730 --> 07:44.130
So specify axis labels.

07:44.970 --> 07:47.210
Uh figure title.

07:47.570 --> 07:52.130
Uh and here I will say the axis limits.

07:52.170 --> 07:52.730
Very nice.

07:52.770 --> 07:57.770
And this also worked out with the with a spacing perfectly, exactly the same length here.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.290
That doesn't always happen like that.

07:59.650 --> 08:08.170
As I mentioned in the first video of this section, Python generates these colors or chooses these colors

08:08.210 --> 08:12.770
automatically based on their built in cycle of colors.

08:12.770 --> 08:16.570
So I don't have to specify these three colors.

08:16.730 --> 08:20.490
All I have to specify is three calls to the plot function.

08:20.730 --> 08:25.810
But what if you want to determine what colors you want to use in the lines?

08:25.970 --> 08:29.410
Now, I've already shown you a little bit how to do this before.

08:29.450 --> 08:32.210
For example, we can make this a red line.

08:32.210 --> 08:34.170
We can force this line to be red.

08:34.530 --> 08:41.530
And what I want to show you now is basically a little bit more about controlling the exact colors that

08:41.530 --> 08:42.450
you can use.

08:42.650 --> 08:46.610
So let's, uh, write some a list of custom colors.

08:46.610 --> 08:50.330
I'm going to write 0.70.30.9.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.490
So this is this should be like this.

08:52.970 --> 08:58.540
Uh, and here I will write hash D6690A.

08:58.780 --> 09:02.780
And then here I'm going to write sky blue like this.

09:02.820 --> 09:03.100
Okay.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.060
So what I have here is a list.

09:05.860 --> 09:11.380
The list is called see you can tell it's a list because it opens and closes with square brackets.

09:11.740 --> 09:14.580
And there are three elements inside the list.

09:14.580 --> 09:18.380
First is another list of also three elements.

09:18.500 --> 09:22.820
And then we have a some text here and some text here.

09:22.820 --> 09:24.020
So what are these three things?

09:24.020 --> 09:28.700
Maybe you've already guessed this corresponds to RGB coordinates.

09:28.700 --> 09:32.900
So this is r g b.

09:33.300 --> 09:38.540
And so this is basically defining a color using red green and blue channels.

09:38.580 --> 09:46.140
Now sometimes when you specify colors you specify colors from 0 to 255.

09:46.340 --> 09:50.540
Here these colors need to be specified between 0 and 1.

09:50.540 --> 09:56.950
So if you have a set of RGB values that are integers between 0 and 255.

09:57.230 --> 10:03.830
You just need to divide them by 255, and that gives you scaled numbers between 0 and 1.

10:04.350 --> 10:11.950
Here I have hex specified color, and here I have just a name for a color that matplotlib recognizes.

10:12.630 --> 10:12.950
Okay.

10:12.990 --> 10:17.710
So now I'll write for I in range length of c.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.910
And now I'm going to create a plot.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.790
It's going to be x by.

10:22.430 --> 10:23.030
Let's do.

10:23.070 --> 10:24.790
How about x plus one.

10:25.390 --> 10:28.670
Actually maybe I'll do like this x plus I.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.510
So I'm just adding some offsets here.

10:30.510 --> 10:31.870
It's just arbitrary stuff.

10:31.910 --> 10:32.910
We just need a line.

10:33.150 --> 10:33.390
Okay.

10:33.430 --> 10:37.190
And then I will write that the color should be equal to c.

10:37.950 --> 10:40.630
So the ith element in c.

10:41.270 --> 10:44.350
And let's see what this looks like.

10:45.270 --> 10:45.550
Okay.

10:45.630 --> 10:47.390
So now we get our three lines.

10:47.390 --> 10:51.110
And you can see the three colors that we have specified here.

10:51.110 --> 10:56.390
So sky blue is this one and this is an orangish color.

10:56.390 --> 11:02.630
And here you can see that this is purple because it's a lot of blue, uh, a moderate amount of red

11:02.630 --> 11:03.590
and very little green.

11:03.590 --> 11:07.510
So that gives us this kind of like lilac purplish color here.

11:07.870 --> 11:08.110
Okay.

11:08.150 --> 11:11.110
And now I'm going to, you know, these lines look a little bit thin.

11:11.110 --> 11:15.710
So I'm going to write line width equals three.

11:16.150 --> 11:18.630
So that is going to make a thicker line.

11:18.670 --> 11:20.550
How about line width equals 13.

11:20.590 --> 11:22.590
That's a little bit too thick.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.470
Uh almost cartoonish I guess.

11:24.470 --> 11:26.150
Cartoonish would be like this.

11:26.150 --> 11:27.390
That's really intense.

11:27.870 --> 11:30.070
How about we do we make the line width.

11:30.230 --> 11:33.230
Uh, how about like, I plus one?

11:33.710 --> 11:39.270
So now you see that the lines are also maybe I'll even do, uh, times two.

11:39.990 --> 11:45.350
So there you see, the lines are successively getting thicker and thicker because the line width is

11:45.350 --> 11:50.350
specified as a function of the looping index variable that I have over here.
