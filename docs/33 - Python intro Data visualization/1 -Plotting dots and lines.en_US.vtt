00:02.680 --> 00:11.320
Over the next several videos, I am going to show you how to visualize data in Python using the library

00:11.320 --> 00:13.440
called matplotlib.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.360
It's quite a mouthful.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.960
It is matplotlib like this.

00:17.320 --> 00:23.560
And in particular there is a module in the matplotlib library called pie plot.

00:23.640 --> 00:32.240
Now this is an awful lot of text to write out every time you want to generate a plot, or modify a plot,

00:32.240 --> 00:33.880
or add something to a plot.

00:34.080 --> 00:40.000
So therefore people typically import this using the abbreviation PLT.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.880
This is nearly universal.

00:41.880 --> 00:46.200
This is basically how most people abbreviate matplotlib.

00:47.600 --> 00:51.320
Okay, so let's do a basic demonstration plt dot plot.

00:51.640 --> 01:00.470
This is the function in the matplotlib pyplot library that will allow you to draw data to a figure,

01:01.430 --> 01:08.430
and the general usage of plt.plot is to input a x coordinate and a y coordinate.

01:08.430 --> 01:11.310
So let's just run this code and see what happens.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.750
So what happens is let's see.

01:13.750 --> 01:20.830
So first of all we get some text output that actually just corresponds to an address where this plot

01:20.870 --> 01:22.710
object is represented.

01:23.030 --> 01:25.590
And now here we see a graph.

01:25.590 --> 01:28.030
We see an axis but it's all white.

01:28.070 --> 01:31.390
Looks like two white bunny rabbits in a snowstorm.

01:31.710 --> 01:33.190
So where are the data?

01:33.190 --> 01:34.550
Where's the data that we drew?

01:34.590 --> 01:41.470
Well, it turns out that this that the plot function actually did draw something at three comma four,

01:41.470 --> 01:45.310
you can see the x axis is three and here is four.

01:45.710 --> 01:49.150
But there's basically just a dot that's so small that you don't see it.

01:49.150 --> 01:56.270
So what we want to do is add some kind of a marker using an optional third input.

01:56.470 --> 02:00.710
So the third input is going to be surrounded by single quotes.

02:00.830 --> 02:03.430
And here I will use an O.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.470
So this is not a zero.

02:05.510 --> 02:06.990
This is the letter O.

02:07.350 --> 02:11.150
And now you see we get a dot here at coordinate three comma four.

02:11.230 --> 02:14.190
So x equals three y equals four.

02:14.350 --> 02:15.550
And then I drew a dot.

02:16.390 --> 02:17.710
Okay let's draw something else.

02:17.710 --> 02:19.150
So plt dot plot.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.190
How about two comma four.

02:21.670 --> 02:24.470
And now here I'm going to draw a square.

02:24.950 --> 02:27.350
So notice here we get a circle.

02:27.510 --> 02:28.950
Here we get a little square.

02:28.950 --> 02:31.670
And you can also see that the colors are different.

02:31.710 --> 02:37.670
Now nowhere in this code did I actually tell Python which colors to use.

02:37.790 --> 02:43.030
Python has a built in sequence of colors that it cycles through.

02:43.270 --> 02:51.030
So it's automatically picking the color for each new plot element based on the order in which that element

02:51.030 --> 02:51.950
is drawn.

02:52.150 --> 02:53.350
Okay, let's do some more.

02:53.350 --> 02:58.820
Let's add some more information to our matplotlib knowledge arsenal.

02:59.020 --> 03:01.780
So first of all, let me I'm just going to redraw some.

03:02.460 --> 03:02.740
Okay.

03:02.780 --> 03:06.100
So now I put an R in front of the O here.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.580
And that gives me a red circle.

03:08.780 --> 03:10.940
And now I will write PLT dot plot.

03:10.980 --> 03:12.100
Let's go for two.

03:12.140 --> 03:14.900
How about I don't know comma minus one.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.860
And what's your favorite color.

03:16.980 --> 03:18.540
Well I think you said blue.

03:18.580 --> 03:21.460
And now I'm going to write the letter P.

03:21.820 --> 03:23.820
P is for Pentagon.

03:24.100 --> 03:27.220
And so here we get the red circle.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.660
And oh and here we get a blue pentagon.

03:30.940 --> 03:36.180
Now when you are looking at this on your screen, it might not be so obvious that these markers have

03:36.180 --> 03:42.900
different shapes, but they actually do in I think the in two videos from now, I will show you how

03:42.900 --> 03:46.900
to stylize these plots to make the markers bigger.

03:46.940 --> 03:48.740
Actually, maybe I'll just show you right now.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.340
There's no reason to wait so long.

03:50.700 --> 03:50.980
Okay.

03:51.020 --> 03:52.060
So I will write comma.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.020
I'm going to add another optional input here.

03:55.090 --> 03:57.810
And this is marker size.

03:57.810 --> 04:00.610
And let's set this marker size to be 20.

04:00.770 --> 04:02.210
Now you see this is much bigger.

04:02.210 --> 04:04.490
How about marker size equals 200.

04:04.650 --> 04:04.970
Okay.

04:05.010 --> 04:11.050
So now this marker is so big that it's like only halfway inside the plot area.

04:11.450 --> 04:12.490
How about two.

04:12.770 --> 04:14.770
Now this marker is really, really small.

04:14.770 --> 04:20.730
It's so small that if your laptop screen is dirty, you might actually mistake this for a little crumb

04:20.770 --> 04:22.090
on your laptop screen.

04:22.570 --> 04:27.730
Okay, so there's no, you know, correct size to make these markers.

04:27.890 --> 04:33.970
It's you just play around with some different values and see what looks good in the plot based on what

04:33.970 --> 04:35.490
else is going on in the plot.

04:35.530 --> 04:37.770
What other information you have drawn to the plot?

04:39.170 --> 04:44.650
Okay, now what if this were from one particular piece of data and this were from a different piece

04:44.650 --> 04:45.490
of data?

04:45.490 --> 04:52.890
We might want to have a legend in here to show us what are the yeah, what these data actually correspond

04:52.890 --> 04:53.210
to.

04:53.560 --> 05:01.080
So to add a legend that you associate with each different call to Plt.plot, you can add another optional

05:01.080 --> 05:02.960
input called label.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.280
So label.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.040
Uh, yeah.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.640
Let's call this data a.

05:07.200 --> 05:11.800
And this one I will say label equals data two.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.440
There you go.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.920
So now we don't have to worry about letters versus numbers here.

05:16.440 --> 05:16.960
Okay.

05:17.240 --> 05:22.400
Uh, hey, where's the, uh, legend I wrote in label for each of these lines.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.560
And it doesn't look like anything changed in the plots.

05:26.040 --> 05:33.200
Okay, so what's going on here is that we have provided information about a legend, but we didn't actually

05:33.240 --> 05:34.840
activate the legend.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.920
So to show the legend, we need to write another function.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.880
And that is called plt dot legend.

05:42.040 --> 05:49.240
Now in this case, this is an example of a function that takes no inputs and provides no outputs.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.480
So there are optional inputs.

05:51.480 --> 05:58.120
For example, if you want to specify the location of the legend, or the font size or the color of the

05:58.120 --> 06:04.560
legend, there are optional inputs that you can provide, but you do not need to provide any inputs

06:04.560 --> 06:06.480
and you don't need to get any outputs.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.040
Okay, so now we see our legend here.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.280
And also the marker here is larger.

06:12.320 --> 06:17.520
The Pentagon is is larger than the circle because of what I specified here.

06:17.960 --> 06:18.280
Okay.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.640
So now let's see what we can do about this pesky address.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.080
Here I will write PLT dot show.

06:24.560 --> 06:29.800
And now it draws the graph without giving an output from any of these previous lines.

06:29.960 --> 06:38.520
Now if you are working in a Jupyter notebook like on Colab, like what you see here, you don't actually

06:38.520 --> 06:40.880
need to write plt dot show it.

06:40.880 --> 06:46.160
Just the figure will always automatically draw whenever you call plt.plot.

06:46.520 --> 06:53.630
But if you are using different Ides, different interactive development environments, then you might

06:53.670 --> 06:59.150
actually need to write plt.show before the graph is actually displayed.

06:59.670 --> 07:00.630
Okay, so there we go.

07:00.630 --> 07:05.550
We get our plots, we get some data, and we have a legend.

07:06.030 --> 07:11.510
So far I've just been manually entering the numbers into Plt.plot.

07:11.670 --> 07:17.510
What I want to demonstrate now is using variables in plt dot plots.

07:17.550 --> 07:22.790
So let's say a equals four and b equals how about 5.6.

07:22.790 --> 07:25.590
And now I write plt dot plot a.

07:25.710 --> 07:31.470
And how about b squared minus a to the power of six.

07:31.790 --> 07:33.070
It's just some random thing.

07:33.350 --> 07:33.670
Okay.

07:33.710 --> 07:39.510
And then let's make this a how about for something different I can make this a triangle.

07:39.790 --> 07:42.430
So here we have an upward facing triangle.

07:42.470 --> 07:45.630
I'm going to do marker size equals 12.

07:45.870 --> 07:50.020
So you can see that this is a upward facing triangle.

07:50.020 --> 07:51.820
That's with the caret symbol here.

07:52.060 --> 07:52.420
Okay.

07:52.460 --> 07:56.180
And yeah, this is not terribly different from what I showed you earlier.

07:56.180 --> 08:02.740
Just so you can see that you can have variables and entire mathematical equations built right into the

08:02.740 --> 08:04.940
Plt.plot function.

08:05.340 --> 08:09.260
All of the plots that I have drawn so far involve dots.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.100
What if we want to draw lines?

08:11.100 --> 08:14.420
How do we draw lines with plt.plot?

08:14.660 --> 08:19.380
So the idea is that we are specifying here an individual point.

08:19.780 --> 08:24.780
And if you want to draw a line you need to specify a set of points.

08:24.780 --> 08:29.980
And then matplotlib will draw a line between those sets of points.

08:30.060 --> 08:34.260
So let me give you a simple illustration of drawing a line.

08:34.260 --> 08:37.380
So I want a line that goes from on the x axis.

08:37.420 --> 08:42.380
It goes from 0 to 1, and on the y axis it goes from 0 to 2.

08:42.660 --> 08:46.140
And let's make this a magenta line.

08:46.820 --> 08:47.140
Okay.

08:47.180 --> 08:54.890
So now you see a line and it goes on the x axis 0 to 1 and the y axis 0 to 2.

08:54.930 --> 08:55.690
So there you go.

08:55.930 --> 09:03.410
One potential point of confusion for drawing lines is that people would initially expect this to be

09:03.410 --> 09:07.330
the the the point x, x1 y1.

09:07.330 --> 09:11.810
And the second input would be the point x2 y2.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.690
So but that is not how it's set up.

09:14.690 --> 09:22.010
It's set up that you first specify all the x axis values, and then you specify all the y axis values

09:22.010 --> 09:22.930
and they get paired.

09:22.930 --> 09:26.210
So this is x1 y1 and this.

09:26.490 --> 09:28.330
So that corresponds to this point here.

09:28.490 --> 09:32.450
And the second numbers are x2 and y2.

09:32.490 --> 09:36.210
And that corresponds to this point over here okay.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.610
So magenta line.

09:37.610 --> 09:40.650
Let's say we want some squares at the end of them.

09:40.810 --> 09:43.530
So now I will write M for square.

09:43.530 --> 09:47.970
So magenta m for magenta and S for square.

09:48.410 --> 09:50.170
And hey, wait a minute.

09:50.170 --> 09:52.690
Where did the line go that got rid of the line?

09:52.730 --> 09:53.930
There's no more line there.

09:54.130 --> 09:58.570
So what we specified here is that the marker should be square.

09:58.810 --> 10:00.890
And that means that no line is drawn.

10:01.010 --> 10:06.690
If you want a line, then you can write a minus sign over here for a dash.

10:07.010 --> 10:08.850
So now we get two markers.

10:08.850 --> 10:14.330
We get the line and we get the the actual markers that I specified here.

10:14.690 --> 10:14.890
Okay.

10:14.930 --> 10:16.330
And there's other options.

10:16.330 --> 10:20.810
For example if you write two minus signs then you get a dashed line.

10:20.930 --> 10:23.850
If you write a colon then you get a dotted line.

10:23.930 --> 10:28.450
There's lots of options that you can do for stylizing these plots.

10:28.690 --> 10:29.010
Okay.

10:29.050 --> 10:30.410
So that is one line.

10:30.410 --> 10:32.530
And now I will draw another line.

10:32.690 --> 10:38.930
And how about I want a straight line that goes across like this a horizontal line.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.650
So how do we draw a horizontal line here.

10:41.810 --> 10:46.520
So the x values are zero and one and what are the Y values?

10:46.520 --> 10:53.480
If I want to line a horizontal line that just goes across here, the y values are they're just zero.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.280
So it's just zero and zero.

10:55.400 --> 10:59.880
And let's make this a green line like this okay.

11:00.160 --> 11:00.920
Very nice.

11:01.720 --> 11:08.200
The last thing I will illustrate in this video is drawing lines with more points that will give us curved

11:08.200 --> 11:10.520
lines instead of just straight lines.

11:10.800 --> 11:18.360
So let me import numpy as np and then I will create one variable x.

11:18.360 --> 11:24.880
Let's make this linearly spaced numbers between 0 and 3 pi I want pi.

11:24.920 --> 11:25.880
You know what pi is.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.080
Pi is the uh this funny number here.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.960
It's 3.14 blah blah blah.

11:31.280 --> 11:37.840
So if we just try writing pi like this, uh, that is unfortunately not defined, but there is a numpy

11:38.080 --> 11:41.120
function for pi, so you just write OOP.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.310
Let me comment this out.

11:43.430 --> 11:44.510
Import numpy.

11:44.750 --> 11:47.230
And now I can write numpy.py.

11:47.230 --> 11:51.110
And this is an approximation of the symbol for pi.

11:51.430 --> 11:51.830
Okay.

11:52.110 --> 11:56.870
So I want numbers from 0 to 3 pi.

11:57.190 --> 11:59.270
And how many numbers do we want between them.

11:59.270 --> 12:06.310
Let's say how about 1001 numbers between 0 and 3 pi.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.670
And let's see what this looks like.

12:08.110 --> 12:08.350
Okay.

12:08.390 --> 12:11.870
So we don't see all the numbers because that would just be gratuitous.

12:12.030 --> 12:14.750
But you can see we the first element is zero.

12:14.790 --> 12:19.270
The next element is 0.0094, etc..

12:19.430 --> 12:23.910
And then it goes all the way up to 9.4, which is three pi.

12:24.350 --> 12:24.750
Okay.

12:24.790 --> 12:29.070
So that is our x vector and y.

12:29.110 --> 12:31.710
And actually let me show you the length too just to confirm.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.830
Uh oops sorry.

12:33.870 --> 12:35.710
That's x dot shape.

12:36.070 --> 12:36.510
Uh, yeah.

12:36.550 --> 12:43.460
Just so you can see that the shape of x, so the size, the dimensions of x is 1001, which is exactly

12:43.460 --> 12:44.620
what I specified here.

12:45.140 --> 12:51.420
Okay, so now I will set Y to be equal to numpy dot sine of x.

12:51.420 --> 12:55.380
So here you see a new function that you may not have come across before.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.020
This is just the sine function.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.540
So like sine and cosine and so on.

13:00.540 --> 13:02.140
It's the Trig function sine.

13:02.420 --> 13:05.700
Now I write plt dot plot x comma y.

13:06.020 --> 13:08.340
Let's make this a black line.

13:08.580 --> 13:13.820
And I'll put a legend in here that says uh pretty sine wave.

13:13.940 --> 13:14.140
Okay.

13:14.180 --> 13:16.220
It's probably not really going to be that pretty.

13:16.260 --> 13:20.140
It's fairly basic, but that's good enough for now.

13:21.300 --> 13:21.740
Okay.

13:21.780 --> 13:24.020
So here we get our sine wave.

13:24.060 --> 13:28.820
Now this looks like a curve but it's actually not really a curve.

13:28.820 --> 13:32.900
It's really a sequence of straight line segments.

13:33.100 --> 13:39.900
But there are 1001 or 1000 segments defined by 1001 points.

13:40.060 --> 13:45.620
And so from this resolution it looks like it's a smooth, curved line.

13:45.620 --> 13:48.660
But really it's just a bunch of straight lines.

13:48.660 --> 13:53.140
Just like here we have a straight line drawn between two points.

13:53.300 --> 14:00.100
And you can see that by for example, if I only do 11 now, you can really see clearly and actually

14:00.380 --> 14:07.020
let me plot this as how about dots with a line like this.

14:07.260 --> 14:08.460
Maybe that's not big enough.

14:08.460 --> 14:09.980
Let's do circles.

14:10.340 --> 14:17.420
Okay, so now you really see that what Python is really drawing is not an actual sine wave, but a sequence

14:17.420 --> 14:25.700
of straight line segments that follow each successive pair of x and y coordinates.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.620
So we get straight line segments.

14:27.620 --> 14:34.180
But when the resolution is pretty high, then yeah, you start to get so many of these line segments

14:34.300 --> 14:37.420
that it looks like it's a smooth, continuous line.
