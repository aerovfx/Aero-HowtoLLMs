00:01.920 --> 00:07.160
Now I'm going to introduce you to subplots sub plots.

00:07.160 --> 00:14.560
The idea of a subplot is to have multiple panels that are next to each other and on top of each other.

00:14.680 --> 00:22.080
And basically, it's a way to show more information from more variables in the same space, in the same

00:22.080 --> 00:22.760
figure.

00:23.080 --> 00:28.360
Okay, so I'll start by writing some code that might look a little strange at first, but you will get

00:28.360 --> 00:29.760
used to it pretty quickly.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.400
So Plt.subplots.

00:32.680 --> 00:38.280
And now I'm going to write one comma three comma fig size equal.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.360
Actually let me leave out fig size for now.

00:40.600 --> 00:40.880
Okay.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.880
So what are these variables that I'm creating.

00:43.520 --> 00:47.840
So fig is a reference to this entire figure.

00:48.160 --> 00:54.040
And then inside this figure are three axes that are arranged in a row.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.880
So here you see axis one, axis two and axis three.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.620
And why are there three in a row.

01:00.660 --> 01:07.460
Well, because I specified the inputs to be a single row and three columns.

01:07.620 --> 01:12.980
So let's say we want six subplots organized in a two by three matrix.

01:12.980 --> 01:14.420
That would be something like this.

01:14.780 --> 01:20.060
And yeah, there's there's no limit to how you can how many of these axes you can make.

01:20.300 --> 01:25.700
But that said, if you have lots and lots of axes, then basically the figure gets harder and harder

01:25.700 --> 01:26.580
to interpret.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.380
So let's leave it at one by three.

01:29.740 --> 01:37.380
And now this additional input parameter that I started to write and then delete was basically controlling

01:37.380 --> 01:38.340
the figure size.

01:38.340 --> 01:39.380
So I will write that now.

01:39.380 --> 01:43.260
So fig size equals 12 by four.

01:43.580 --> 01:51.180
Now when I run this line of code I want you to notice what happens to the physical size of this figure

01:51.220 --> 01:51.740
here.

01:52.540 --> 01:52.700
Okay.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.260
So now I run the code again.

01:54.260 --> 01:57.500
And now you see the figure is much wider.

01:57.540 --> 01:57.780
Okay.

01:57.820 --> 02:01.010
And now I can set this to be 12 comma two.

02:01.370 --> 02:05.530
And now it's exactly the same width, but it's shorter.

02:05.690 --> 02:09.570
And now I can change this to maybe five by two.

02:09.890 --> 02:13.770
And now it's the same height but it's much shorter in this direction.

02:14.290 --> 02:18.730
Okay so fig size is always specified as width comma height.

02:19.090 --> 02:22.490
And then yeah exactly how big you want these to be.

02:22.530 --> 02:24.050
And the ratio between them.

02:24.170 --> 02:30.810
That really depends on the graph on your computer on you know how much you're zooming in here and so

02:30.810 --> 02:31.210
on.

02:31.330 --> 02:36.690
So you will find that in practice you end up changing around these numbers quite a bit.

02:36.930 --> 02:37.210
Okay.

02:37.210 --> 02:40.850
Let's stick with 12 and four okay.

02:40.890 --> 02:44.210
So this variable axes let's have a look at this thing.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.010
Axes.

02:45.210 --> 02:47.130
This you can see it's an array.

02:47.130 --> 02:48.850
So it's a numpy array.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.610
And it contains three elements.

02:51.610 --> 02:55.570
This is axis one, axis two and axis three.

02:55.810 --> 02:59.010
Actually I should be calling the zero one and two okay.

02:59.050 --> 03:08.070
So the idea is that if we want to draw information into this axis over here, this subplot, then instead

03:08.070 --> 03:17.870
of writing plt dot plot, we write axis indexing the first element in this variable axis and and then

03:17.910 --> 03:20.310
yeah, then we do that dot plot okay.

03:20.350 --> 03:24.070
So for example let's do x by x squared.

03:24.110 --> 03:27.590
Let's make this a blue line okay.

03:27.630 --> 03:33.470
So now you see I drew x by x squared and it went into the first axis.

03:33.510 --> 03:36.630
And now I can draw it into the second axis and so on.

03:37.310 --> 03:39.990
So that is x squared.

03:39.990 --> 03:42.110
And now in the next.

03:42.150 --> 03:45.030
So the middle subplot let's let's plot the.

03:45.310 --> 03:47.110
How about the square root of x.

03:47.110 --> 03:48.990
Let's make that red.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.830
And here let's plot.

03:51.950 --> 03:55.270
Uh how about just x by x okay.

03:55.310 --> 03:55.990
Very nice.

03:55.990 --> 03:56.470
Let's see.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.060
Let's do another example here I will.

03:59.060 --> 04:02.020
Right now I don't actually need this variable fig.

04:02.020 --> 04:04.620
So I'm going to just write an underscore here.

04:04.620 --> 04:10.740
This is pretty common in Python when you have a variable that outputs from a function, but you don't

04:10.740 --> 04:13.500
care about that variable, you don't plan on using it.

04:13.500 --> 04:19.580
So you just use an underscore as a placeholder for the variables so that you just, you know, you kind

04:19.580 --> 04:23.540
of it's technically there, but you sweep it out of your memory.

04:23.900 --> 04:24.220
Okay.

04:24.260 --> 04:30.340
So plt.subplots, let's make a two by two, uh, axis, uh, or geometry.

04:30.540 --> 04:34.300
And I'm going to set the figure size to be how about three by three.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.740
And then I'll draw plt.show all the way at the bottom.

04:38.740 --> 04:47.020
Now if I just run this code here, you can already see that the default axis labels are overlapping.

04:47.180 --> 04:47.420
Right.

04:47.460 --> 04:51.540
So the 0.5 and one are overlapping.

04:51.580 --> 04:56.220
You know these are actually the x tick marks from this plot over here.

04:56.340 --> 05:00.720
But they get kind of smushed and smeared on top of this other axis.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.120
So we're going to have to figure out a way to deal with that.

05:03.480 --> 05:10.520
Now here I showed you just indexing the axis variable that I created because it's an array.

05:10.520 --> 05:13.000
So we only needed one number to access it.

05:13.240 --> 05:19.480
But here we can see that this is actually a two by two matrix.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.160
So here we have a matrix of subplots.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.560
So this variable axis is a two by two matrix.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.880
So how do we index this.

05:28.880 --> 05:34.520
So we need to use two numbers to index each one of these axes okay.

05:34.720 --> 05:39.040
And so now we can draw into the zero zero.

05:39.040 --> 05:44.440
So this is the first row and the first column which is this axis over here.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.440
And now dot plot.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.680
What should we plot here.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.400
How about just some random numbers.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.960
I'm just going to draw 4x4 random numbers okay.

05:55.120 --> 06:02.540
So here you see four lines correspond and of length for each, and that just corresponds to for random

06:02.540 --> 06:02.980
numbers.

06:02.980 --> 06:07.140
So each time I rerun this code those lines will look different from each other.

06:07.580 --> 06:14.180
Okay, so then I'm literally going to copy and paste this four times, or paste it three times, and

06:14.180 --> 06:17.340
then change that to one, these to one, this to one.

06:17.340 --> 06:20.860
So now I'm just drawing literally random numbers into each plot.

06:21.420 --> 06:21.740
Okay.

06:21.740 --> 06:28.660
What I want to show you here is first of all, indexing multi-dimensional axes, but also how to get

06:28.700 --> 06:30.780
rid of the, you know, the overlap here.

06:30.780 --> 06:34.980
So I'm going to add another function called tight layout.

06:35.340 --> 06:36.060
Tight layout.

06:36.060 --> 06:44.180
And what that does is tighten up all of the displays of the figures and the axes so that they are not

06:44.180 --> 06:46.180
overlapping with each other.

06:46.180 --> 06:52.260
So basically, every single time you have more than one axis in a plot, you're going to want to use

06:52.260 --> 06:53.980
this function tight layout.

06:54.020 --> 06:56.900
So just get in the habit of writing these out.

06:57.650 --> 07:05.570
You will see that as you get further in visualization, you'll be using more and more of these additional

07:05.730 --> 07:11.970
functions with optional inputs to create these figures and make them look nicer.

07:12.330 --> 07:20.810
One more concept that I want to illustrate in this video is using the enumerate function that you learned

07:20.810 --> 07:29.490
about in the previous section, to organize a or to draw information into graphs using a for loop.

07:29.810 --> 07:34.130
Okay, so let's create some axes Plt.subplots.

07:34.130 --> 07:41.410
And let's just go back to three Figsize equals how about 13.1 and three.

07:41.610 --> 07:46.850
You know, and I'll even make this pie just to show you that these numbers here corresponding to the

07:46.850 --> 07:52.050
figure sizes, they need to be numbers but they don't need to be integers okay.

07:52.090 --> 07:57.350
So 13.1 units wide and pi units high.

07:57.550 --> 08:04.870
I believe these are technically in inches based on a standard piece of paper, but don't think of these

08:04.870 --> 08:08.470
as inches because it really depends on your screen size.

08:08.510 --> 08:14.670
You know, obviously the number of inches that this spans is now very different when I zoom in to ridiculous

08:14.670 --> 08:15.550
proportions.

08:16.150 --> 08:16.430
Okay.

08:16.470 --> 08:19.870
So what I'm going to do now is write a for loop.

08:19.990 --> 08:30.550
And this is going to be exp which I'm using for exponential and then axis in enumerate axes like this.

08:30.910 --> 08:36.830
So now I'm going to be looping over all of the elements in this array.

08:37.430 --> 08:42.590
And I'm also going to create a looping index that starts at zero.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.150
And then it's going to go one two.

08:44.430 --> 08:47.150
And that goes into this variable exp.

08:47.670 --> 08:50.550
So now I can write axis dot plot.

08:50.830 --> 08:54.590
And then let's do x and x to the power of exp.

08:55.070 --> 08:57.380
And let's just start like this.

08:59.140 --> 08:59.540
Okay.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.020
So what have we done here?

09:02.020 --> 09:07.980
I have created a figure with three axes of a one by three geometry.

09:08.340 --> 09:16.300
And then in this for loop I am accessing each individual element in this variable because that's what's

09:16.300 --> 09:17.580
inside enumerate.

09:17.940 --> 09:22.700
And at each iteration in this for loop I call that variable axis.

09:23.100 --> 09:27.420
And then what I'm plotting into axis is x on the x axis.

09:27.820 --> 09:34.220
And the y axis values are x to the power of the looping index variable, which here is zero.

09:34.220 --> 09:39.660
So this is x to the power of zero, x to the power of one which is just x.

09:39.660 --> 09:41.500
And here's x to the power of two.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.140
Of course that's x squared.

09:43.460 --> 09:43.940
Okay.

09:44.180 --> 09:50.740
And then actually these figures are big enough that we don't really need to include PLT dot title layout.

09:50.740 --> 09:54.820
But it's good to get in the habit of including that piece of code anyway.
