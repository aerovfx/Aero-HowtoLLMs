00:02.000 --> 00:06.960
Welcome to this video in which you are going to learn about four loops.

00:06.960 --> 00:10.360
That is a very exciting topic to learn about for loops.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.960
Not to be confused with Fruit Loops, or I think it's actually spelled Fruit Loops.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
But anyway, what I'm going to do is just start typing and then I will explain what is going on in this

00:23.000 --> 00:23.520
code.

00:24.120 --> 00:31.280
Okay, so I typed some things and now I run this cell and we see the numbers zero through five being

00:31.280 --> 00:32.840
printed out okay.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.800
So this is the concept of a for loop.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.680
We have the keyword for.

00:38.120 --> 00:42.760
And then here another keyword in and then colon okay.

00:42.800 --> 00:48.000
So the keyword four tells Python that we are about to initiate a for loop.

00:48.440 --> 00:52.160
And then we have a looping variable over here.

00:52.160 --> 00:58.080
This is a variable that changes its value at each iteration of the for loop.

00:58.280 --> 01:01.400
Sometimes these are numerical values like this.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.640
You see, these are numbers.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.960
Sometimes they are elements of a list.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.400
So they can be strings.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.880
They can be lots of different types of iterating variables.

01:10.880 --> 01:16.360
And then we have this reserved keyword in that always has to be there in a for loop when you're setting

01:16.360 --> 01:17.200
up a for loop.

01:17.520 --> 01:21.600
And then we have this item here is called the iterable.

01:21.760 --> 01:27.400
So right now I have it set to be this function range which you have seen multiple times before.

01:28.520 --> 01:33.600
But in general this needs to be any type of variable that can be considered an iterable.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.000
And what is an iterable?

01:35.040 --> 01:38.240
An iterable is a type of variable that can iterate.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.000
And what does it mean to iterate?

01:40.000 --> 01:48.120
It means to basically draw an element out of the the variable, like a list or a set, or a range,

01:48.120 --> 01:50.880
or a matrix or an array one by one.

01:51.240 --> 01:51.520
Okay.

01:51.560 --> 01:58.840
And then once we're inside the for loop, then we can work with this iterable variable, this looping

01:58.840 --> 02:01.570
index variable in this case and do whatever.

02:01.570 --> 02:03.330
So in this case I'm just printing it out.

02:03.650 --> 02:10.370
Now notice again this is similar to what you saw in a couple videos ago in the previous section about

02:10.370 --> 02:12.930
spacing when defining functions.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.330
So here the spacing is similar.

02:15.330 --> 02:20.090
So now I can write print end of for loop like this.

02:20.410 --> 02:24.970
Now this text here has two spaces.

02:25.010 --> 02:26.570
Again it can be two spaces.

02:26.570 --> 02:28.010
It can be four spaces.

02:28.130 --> 02:35.930
As long as you are consistent about using either 2 or 4 spaces within a given control statement or function,

02:35.930 --> 02:36.730
then it's fine.

02:36.930 --> 02:39.210
I like two because I think it just looks nicer.

02:40.370 --> 02:43.450
So all of this text is inside the for loop.

02:43.450 --> 02:50.650
That means that all of this code gets run in this case six times, and then as soon as you get rid of

02:50.650 --> 02:56.770
the spaces here, then the horizontal spaces, then that's the code that's outside the for loop.

02:56.770 --> 03:02.770
So here we have the variable I on each iteration, it's changing its value.

03:03.010 --> 03:06.810
And then we have the, you know, whatever code is after the for loop.

03:07.250 --> 03:07.610
Okay.

03:07.650 --> 03:15.530
So, uh, as you know from me explaining, uh, concepts about counting in Python, we start at zero.

03:15.930 --> 03:18.810
And this is an exclusive upper bound.

03:18.810 --> 03:21.570
So we actually end at the number five.

03:22.210 --> 03:22.610
Okay.

03:22.650 --> 03:25.490
So a little bit more about uh for loops.

03:25.490 --> 03:28.370
Let's see I can go from 4 to 10.

03:28.650 --> 03:34.730
And just to show you here that we can also work with these, uh, with this iterable as if it is a normal

03:34.730 --> 03:35.250
variable.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.650
It is a normal variable.

03:36.930 --> 03:42.890
So I can not only print it out, I can also do mathematical operations on it like square it.

03:42.890 --> 03:47.010
So here you see we get 416 525.

03:47.010 --> 03:48.530
And what do these numbers mean.

03:48.530 --> 03:56.090
Well it's printing out I which is the looping index that is going from four through nine.

03:56.930 --> 03:59.690
So four inclusive nine exclusive.

03:59.810 --> 04:02.420
And then I'm just squaring those numbers over here.

04:02.420 --> 04:03.540
Pretty straightforward.

04:03.660 --> 04:07.260
Let me now show you another example of a for loop.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.660
First I'm going to create some numbers.

04:09.660 --> 04:15.140
So let's say I want linearly spaced numbers between 3 and 17.

04:15.140 --> 04:17.540
And how about let's make 21 of these.

04:17.980 --> 04:20.860
Now what do you think is going to happen when I run this code?

04:21.380 --> 04:25.300
You're probably already thinking that it might give an error because I asked the question.

04:25.820 --> 04:28.620
So the answer is it is going to give an error.

04:28.900 --> 04:34.860
And what I want you to do is make sure that you understand what this error message means and how we

04:34.860 --> 04:35.980
can fix it.

04:36.700 --> 04:37.060
Okay.

04:37.100 --> 04:43.660
So what this error message means is that I'm trying to access the numpy library, but I have not yet

04:43.660 --> 04:44.580
imported it.

04:44.620 --> 04:51.420
See, this is a brand new fresh notebook file and I haven't yet imported numpy.

04:51.860 --> 04:54.500
Now we can import numpy anywhere we want.

04:54.540 --> 04:58.180
I can put it right here import numpy as np.

04:58.620 --> 04:59.660
But and that's fine.

04:59.660 --> 05:00.620
This will now not work.

05:00.860 --> 05:02.540
But it is good practice.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.940
It's good coding etiquette in Python.

05:05.140 --> 05:11.220
To import all of the libraries that you will need at the top of the code file.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.100
So I'm going to say I'm going to write a comment here.

05:14.340 --> 05:17.140
Import necessary libraries.

05:17.380 --> 05:19.860
Now right now we only need one library.

05:19.860 --> 05:24.700
But in the future you will be importing matplotlib.

05:24.700 --> 05:29.820
You'll be importing PyTorch, you'll be importing, you know, maybe SciPy.

05:29.860 --> 05:35.660
There's all sorts of libraries that you are going to be importing when you actually start writing real

05:35.660 --> 05:36.100
code.

05:36.900 --> 05:42.340
So it's good to have all of the import calls at the top of the code file.

05:42.660 --> 05:45.620
Okay, so anyway, now this works here.

05:46.340 --> 05:53.060
And now what I want to do is loop over, not just loop over indices that I define here from range,

05:53.060 --> 05:55.940
but loop over the numbers in here.

05:56.300 --> 05:59.980
So here we have our vector of numbers 3 to 17.

06:00.350 --> 06:03.430
And now what I want to do is loop over these numbers.

06:03.430 --> 06:09.350
So there's a couple of ways we can do this, depending on what kinds of calculations you need to solve

06:09.550 --> 06:10.870
inside the for loop.

06:10.950 --> 06:12.830
So for starters I'm going to write.

06:12.870 --> 06:21.150
Actually I'll write this ID this is short for index index id so for id in range.

06:21.350 --> 06:24.390
And now how many elements do we want in this range.

06:24.390 --> 06:27.030
If we want to access each of these numbers.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.750
Well the answer is 21.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.190
And how do I know it's 21.

06:31.190 --> 06:36.870
Because I specified in this linspace function that I want 21 numbers.

06:36.870 --> 06:41.510
But you know, maybe at some point later on I want to change this to 24.

06:41.670 --> 06:44.830
So then it's not very convenient to have to change this as well.

06:45.070 --> 06:50.070
So therefore I'm going to use a function Len for length and numbers.

06:50.070 --> 06:54.310
So this is a concept encoding called soft coding.

06:54.510 --> 06:57.830
So soft soft coding.

06:57.830 --> 07:06.590
Soft coding is where you only specify the parameters numerically at the beginning of a code file or

07:06.590 --> 07:12.310
the beginning of a cell, and thereafter, every time you need to access that information, you can

07:12.310 --> 07:17.230
just write calls to variables that you have previously defined.

07:17.270 --> 07:23.790
So now when I change this back to 21, I don't need to change anything in here that's going to automatically

07:23.790 --> 07:27.790
dynamically reset back to 21 when I run the code again.

07:28.310 --> 07:28.670
Okay.

07:28.710 --> 07:30.230
So let's see what should we do here?

07:30.230 --> 07:31.950
I'm going to extract a number.

07:31.990 --> 07:33.750
Maybe I'll put in a comment here as well.

07:34.110 --> 07:38.190
Extract one element of this array.

07:38.550 --> 07:40.830
And here I'm going to use indexing.

07:40.830 --> 07:42.670
So numbers ID.

07:42.870 --> 07:47.950
So this is going to be the id element of numbers this vector.

07:48.190 --> 07:51.990
And then I'm going to print out some information.

07:52.590 --> 08:05.590
So let's see I'm going to print out iteration plus string I Plus has a value of plus string x.

08:05.630 --> 08:05.870
Okay.

08:05.910 --> 08:07.190
So let's see what we're doing here.

08:07.390 --> 08:09.030
We are extracting up.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.830
This is id x not I.

08:11.750 --> 08:20.950
We are looping over all the elements in this numpy array, extracting some information and then printing

08:20.950 --> 08:22.070
out a helpful message.

08:22.070 --> 08:27.430
So at this particular iteration we have a value of whatever this number happens to be.

08:27.870 --> 08:28.190
Okay.

08:28.230 --> 08:33.790
This is a very similar formulation to what you will be using when you train models.

08:33.790 --> 08:40.550
When you train deep learning models, you're going to want to print out information about how long into

08:40.550 --> 08:48.350
the training you are, maybe the loss function, maybe some other information about the model performance,

08:48.350 --> 08:51.270
or about some other aspect of the training set.

08:51.510 --> 08:55.110
So this kind of formulation you're going to be using quite often.

08:55.350 --> 09:00.960
Now it turns out that there is actually a better way to print out all this information which I have

09:00.960 --> 09:03.920
mentioned before, only briefly.

09:03.920 --> 09:10.360
I haven't yet introduced you to f strings, but we will get back to that later in the Python tutorial.

09:10.720 --> 09:17.360
What I'd like to do now is show you one more example of a for loop, and this will be combining a for

09:17.400 --> 09:19.360
loop with a function.

09:19.560 --> 09:28.320
And the idea of this for loop inside a function is going to be to calculate the Fibonacci Fibonacci

09:28.360 --> 09:30.000
series okay.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.760
So the idea of a Fibonacci series.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.160
I'm sure you've heard of Fibonacci numbers.

09:35.560 --> 09:39.280
The idea of Fibonacci series is that you have.

09:39.480 --> 09:46.560
You start off with the vectors with the numbers zero, one, and then each number after that is the

09:46.600 --> 09:48.840
sum of the previous two numbers.

09:48.840 --> 09:52.600
So the value of this number is zero plus one.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.480
This number over here becomes the sum of the previous two numbers.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.680
So that becomes two.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.840
And what is what do we put for this element here?

10:00.960 --> 10:03.280
Well, it's the sum of the previous two numbers.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.320
So that's one plus two equals three.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.080
And then the next one is five and the next one is eight.

10:08.080 --> 10:08.920
And so on.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.080
These numbers grow really large really fast okay.

10:12.120 --> 10:17.480
So what we want to do is create an array that is going to keep growing.

10:17.840 --> 10:24.760
And each element in the array is defined as the sum of the previous two elements in this array.

10:25.680 --> 10:31.480
So if you would like to pause the video and see if you can program the Fibonacci series on your own,

10:31.600 --> 10:32.560
then that's great.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.760
I encourage you to do that.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.920
Otherwise I'm going to do it now and you can follow along with me.

10:38.360 --> 10:38.640
Okay.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.640
So we need to initialize.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.680
Initialize a vector.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.280
And I'm going to call this v.

10:45.400 --> 10:50.480
And now actually this is more like mathematically this is a vector.

10:50.480 --> 10:54.320
But in terms of Python data types it's actually a list.

10:54.480 --> 11:00.810
But we're thinking about it in terms of a vector because it contains an ordered sequence of numbers.

11:01.370 --> 11:01.730
Okay.

11:01.770 --> 11:04.170
So now what we want is a for loop.

11:04.170 --> 11:06.290
So for I in range.

11:06.490 --> 11:08.330
And let's start with for.

11:08.490 --> 11:10.690
I'm going to replace this with a variable.

11:10.690 --> 11:12.490
But for now let's just say for.

11:12.530 --> 11:16.050
This means I'm going to update this four times.

11:16.450 --> 11:16.730
Okay.

11:16.770 --> 11:17.770
So what do we need to do.

11:17.770 --> 11:26.770
We need to calculate the sum of v from the end minus two up until the current position.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.010
So that's going to give me this.

11:28.010 --> 11:29.970
So let me just print this out here.

11:31.370 --> 11:31.730
Okay.

11:31.770 --> 11:34.850
So what we get is just a bunch of ones.

11:34.850 --> 11:36.250
And why are we getting ones.

11:36.370 --> 11:39.290
Well you know this calculation is correct.

11:40.130 --> 11:45.530
But the next thing we need to do is make this list grow by the sum.

11:45.530 --> 11:52.450
So this list actually needs to adopt new elements each, uh, each time we go at each iteration through

11:52.450 --> 11:53.330
this for loop.

11:53.730 --> 11:54.050
Okay.

11:54.090 --> 11:59.450
So to do that we can use a method on this list called append.

11:59.810 --> 12:02.210
So I'm going to write like.

12:05.450 --> 12:06.090
This.

12:06.530 --> 12:06.850
Okay.

12:06.890 --> 12:09.010
And then here I will check out v.

12:09.010 --> 12:10.610
So v dot append.

12:10.810 --> 12:12.330
This is a method.

12:13.290 --> 12:18.050
And a method is like a function but it acts on a particular variable.

12:18.290 --> 12:25.850
I'll talk more about methods later on in this tutorial when I introduce you to object oriented programming

12:25.850 --> 12:27.090
and classes.

12:27.330 --> 12:32.970
Okay, so for now, suffice it to say that there are certain types of variables that have particular

12:32.970 --> 12:35.090
functions attached to them.

12:35.610 --> 12:39.730
And yeah, and append on a list is one example.

12:40.090 --> 12:40.370
Okay.

12:40.410 --> 12:44.050
So here we have the beginning of a Fibonacci series.

12:44.250 --> 12:48.530
Now I said that we are going to have a function and a for loop.

12:48.530 --> 12:52.370
At the same time I have not actually created a function.

12:52.650 --> 12:56.010
So what I'm going to do now is create a function.

12:56.010 --> 13:00.180
I'll call this fib seek for Fibonacci sequence.

13:00.180 --> 13:08.940
It's going to take one input, which is n, and that is going to be the variable in this range function

13:08.940 --> 13:09.660
over here.

13:10.100 --> 13:10.420
Okay.

13:10.460 --> 13:14.500
And then we want to return v okay.

13:14.540 --> 13:15.820
So let's see.

13:15.860 --> 13:21.180
Now I can run this code cell to initialize this function.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.580
And now I can call it so fib seek.

13:24.860 --> 13:30.900
And first of all we can confirm that when we provide no inputs then we get an error message.

13:30.900 --> 13:34.340
It's missing one required positional argument.

13:34.340 --> 13:39.340
Again argument is like a fancy term for input n okay.

13:39.380 --> 13:44.220
So the function crashed because it's expecting an input but it didn't get one.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.500
So now I will write.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.380
How about five.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.660
Okay that's great.

13:47.700 --> 13:48.620
How about nine.

13:48.860 --> 13:51.180
Pretty interesting 15.

13:51.340 --> 13:54.140
And you know these numbers get pretty big pretty quickly.

13:54.140 --> 13:58.260
So here we are already at 121,000.
