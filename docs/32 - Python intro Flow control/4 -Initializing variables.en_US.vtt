00:01.960 --> 00:10.360
I will begin this video with an example to show you the problem that initialization will solve.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.920
So for I in range ten.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.360
So I'm just going to create a for loop.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.160
Here are of.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.520
So the ith element in R is I squared.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.000
And then let's print out r.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.200
So what are we doing in this for loop.

00:23.200 --> 00:28.480
So we are looping over the numbers the integers from zero through nine.

00:28.840 --> 00:36.120
And I want to create a new list where each element in this list is defined by I squared.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.720
Really straightforward.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.320
But when I run this we get a problem.

00:40.360 --> 00:44.240
And the problem is that R is not defined.

00:44.240 --> 00:47.560
So I haven't yet defined this variable for R.

00:47.600 --> 00:55.200
So essentially what's going on here is we are trying to access an element of a list that does not exist.

00:55.440 --> 01:02.590
So I'm saying you know, please give me access to the zeroth element or the first element in this list

01:02.590 --> 01:05.510
R and Python says what list are?

01:05.550 --> 01:06.630
There is no list R.

01:07.070 --> 01:13.270
Okay, so what we need to do here is initialize this variable R okay.

01:13.310 --> 01:20.790
Now I'm going to do this in numpy because uh well you often need to initialize in numpy.

01:20.790 --> 01:25.670
And numpy also provides a bunch of useful ways to initialize variables.

01:25.670 --> 01:28.470
So import numpy as NP.

01:28.910 --> 01:34.150
And as I mentioned in a previous video, when you're coding for real, it's actually good to have all

01:34.190 --> 01:40.110
of these library imports be all the way at the top of the script, and not just whenever you need them

01:40.110 --> 01:41.310
as you're going along.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.230
But this is just a little tutorial.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.590
You can see I haven't even named this file yet.

01:46.070 --> 01:48.990
Okay, so, uh, let me do this.

01:48.990 --> 01:53.790
So r equals numpy dot zeros ten.

01:54.230 --> 01:54.430
Okay.

01:54.470 --> 01:56.070
And then I'm going to print out r.

01:56.110 --> 01:58.030
So r is an array.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.350
It's a numpy array.

01:59.350 --> 02:01.470
And it's just ten zeros in a row.

02:01.870 --> 02:06.770
Now I will Copy and paste this code again.

02:07.570 --> 02:09.650
And now let's try running this code again.

02:09.690 --> 02:10.010
Okay.

02:10.050 --> 02:15.930
And now we get no errors, no warnings, and we get exactly the desired outcome here.

02:16.410 --> 02:16.730
All right.

02:16.730 --> 02:18.810
So what would happen if we do.

02:18.850 --> 02:22.690
Let's say I'll initialize this to be 13 zeros.

02:22.730 --> 02:25.090
And now here I have a range up to ten.

02:25.410 --> 02:28.050
What do you think is going to be the value of R.

02:28.090 --> 02:29.290
Or what do you think is going to happen.

02:29.290 --> 02:31.450
Maybe we're going to get an error message.

02:31.450 --> 02:32.570
Let's see what happens.

02:33.930 --> 02:34.170
Okay.

02:34.210 --> 02:39.530
So what happens is this for loop only went up to ten numbers.

02:39.530 --> 02:42.730
So the up to a value of nine.

02:42.730 --> 02:48.450
And then afterwards we have zeros because that's how I initialize the variable r okay.

02:48.490 --> 02:52.570
Now let's try the other way I'm going to initialize this to ten.

02:52.890 --> 02:55.330
And here this is going to go up to 13.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.570
Now what do you think is going to happen here.

02:57.890 --> 03:00.290
Feel free to pause the video and make a guess.

03:00.530 --> 03:02.850
Let's run it and find out okay.

03:02.890 --> 03:04.290
We get an error message.

03:04.450 --> 03:05.960
And what is the error message?

03:05.960 --> 03:11.640
The error message is index ten is out of bounds for x is zero.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.480
Don't worry about this.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.680
But size ten.

03:13.880 --> 03:19.240
So basically here we have a kind of similar problem to what we encountered in the beginning of this

03:19.240 --> 03:19.840
video.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.440
But here the variable r actually does exist.

03:23.440 --> 03:31.120
But we are trying to access an element that is longer than the list itself, or then the numpy array.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.200
So we can still look at what r is equal to.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.960
And this part is all correct.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.400
You know this is I squared.

03:37.920 --> 03:42.640
But now we are trying to access the 11th element.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.800
But there's only ten elements in there.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.680
So we get an error message okay.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.480
So I think this looks ugly.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.040
Let me see.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.600
Oh we can soft code this.

03:52.040 --> 03:56.480
Let's do a array size equals 12.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.280
And now I can use this as a variable.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.880
I'm going to copy and paste this into here.

04:02.240 --> 04:09.340
And this is a good example of soft coding because now I only need to change this variable, this number

04:09.340 --> 04:14.460
here, and that will automatically update all of the other relevant variables here.

04:14.460 --> 04:15.900
So I can change this to 12.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.540
I can change this to 15.

04:17.820 --> 04:23.740
And I don't need to worry about changing this number 15 multiple times.

04:24.180 --> 04:28.100
So here we initialize this variable using zeros.

04:28.340 --> 04:34.420
And now I'm going to show you another option for initializing variables in Python.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.500
So we can use the function full.

04:36.820 --> 04:38.100
And here I will write ten.

04:38.140 --> 04:39.780
Actually let me write array size.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.100
So this is still soft coded.

04:41.220 --> 04:43.420
And now I'll write zero okay.

04:43.460 --> 04:46.380
So here we get zeros and you can count them.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.740
There's going to be 15 of them okay.

04:48.780 --> 04:51.460
And now let's say we want to initialize this to one.

04:51.460 --> 04:53.500
So we can initialize it to tens.

04:53.780 --> 04:57.340
We can initialize it to I don't know -99.

04:57.580 --> 05:05.180
We can initialize it to n a numpy dot n a n nan stands for not a number.

05:05.500 --> 05:11.930
This is a mathematical value that is used in place of dividing by zero.

05:11.930 --> 05:19.570
So having an expression like zero divided by zero that produces Nan Nans are sometimes used in applied

05:19.570 --> 05:25.330
mathematics when coding math in Python when you want to ignore particular values.

05:25.370 --> 05:32.690
Let's say you need to filter out certain values because they are particularly noisy, or because they

05:32.730 --> 05:39.450
are irrelevant, or they're related to processing some other condition, and so you want to remove them

05:39.450 --> 05:42.650
from the data set or the data array.

05:42.890 --> 05:46.530
And replacing the numbers with Nans is one way to do that.

05:46.730 --> 05:47.050
Okay.

05:47.090 --> 05:54.370
So here are two common ways to initialize a variable before you start populating a variable using a

05:54.370 --> 05:54.930
for loop.

05:54.930 --> 05:58.730
So numpy dot zeros and numpy dot full.

05:58.930 --> 06:01.890
These are all vectors that I've shown you so far.

06:01.890 --> 06:04.450
We can also initialize matrices.

06:04.770 --> 06:06.930
So here I have.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.130
This is going to give me.

06:08.170 --> 06:09.570
Oops it's zeros.

06:10.190 --> 06:14.430
This is going to give me an array of four zeros.

06:14.430 --> 06:18.630
But let's say we want a 4x4 matrix of zeros.

06:18.990 --> 06:20.870
You might think of doing something like this.

06:20.870 --> 06:22.110
That seems sensible.

06:22.310 --> 06:29.510
Unfortunately that's not quite the correct syntax because here numpy is expecting the second input to

06:29.510 --> 06:30.750
be the data type.

06:30.750 --> 06:34.990
So for example if these would be integers or floating point numbers.

06:35.550 --> 06:43.550
So what we need to do is actually provide a tuple as the first input into numpy dot zeros.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.910
So here I still have 4x4.

06:45.950 --> 06:50.550
This is the size of the matrix that we are initializing as zeros.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.870
But I'm just surrounding these in parentheses.

06:54.430 --> 06:54.710
Okay.

06:54.750 --> 06:57.830
So this is actually just the first input in here.

06:58.230 --> 07:03.070
And then yeah if we wanted these to be integers I could write dtype equals int.

07:03.350 --> 07:04.350
And now we get ints.

07:04.390 --> 07:08.270
Now these are still zeros just like these are zeros.

07:08.270 --> 07:11.780
But notice that these zeros all have decimal points on them.

07:11.780 --> 07:16.540
So these are floating point numbers and these are just integers.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.620
So here is a question.

07:18.620 --> 07:22.140
Do we always need to initialize variables.

07:22.380 --> 07:23.340
The answer is no.

07:23.340 --> 07:24.740
You don't always need to.

07:25.500 --> 07:33.900
And I've shown you several examples of appending lists so that they continue growing inside of a for

07:33.940 --> 07:34.340
loop.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.140
So here's a simple example.

07:36.220 --> 07:43.260
So here I'm initializing this list are actually let me copy this from here.

07:45.180 --> 07:46.300
So let's go back here.

07:46.300 --> 07:49.580
So now I'm initializing R to be an empty list.

07:49.580 --> 07:54.580
And now I will write r dot append like this.

07:54.580 --> 07:55.980
And so now this works.

07:55.980 --> 08:00.220
So now this variable R starts off as an empty list.

08:00.420 --> 08:03.620
And then here we just get the length of the list as one.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.220
And then the length of the list is two.

08:05.420 --> 08:09.700
And in fact we can write this out print the length of r.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.760
So now we see that at every iteration.

08:13.760 --> 08:18.040
In this for loop R is actually growing in size.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.520
I can show you that as well.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.320
So this looks nice.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.280
It's like a ski slope or something.

08:23.960 --> 08:30.960
So you can see that the length of R is increasing as we go throughout this for loop versus.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.600
If I would initialize this to be zeros then we can say oh wait then this needs to be different.

08:38.600 --> 08:42.600
So now this goes back to indexing equals I squared.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.840
And now you can see here it's all zeros.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.400
Here it's zero one.

08:47.400 --> 08:51.400
And then zeros 014 and then all zeros and so on.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.400
And so the zeros are decreasing.

08:53.400 --> 08:57.680
But the size of the array is the same at each iteration.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.880
So this is a method for.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.400
Let me just go back like this here.

09:04.400 --> 09:08.160
This is a method for appending uh lists.

09:08.320 --> 09:12.840
And we can also do something similar with numpy arrays.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.910
So we have to initialize this to be a numpy array.

09:17.430 --> 09:18.710
So now this is.

09:19.430 --> 09:20.750
This is a list in here.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.110
This is an empty list.

09:22.110 --> 09:26.950
And then I'm converting this into a data type numpy array.

09:27.470 --> 09:27.790
Okay.

09:27.830 --> 09:31.110
And now the formulation is slightly different in numpy.

09:31.150 --> 09:34.750
So r equals numpy dot append.

09:35.070 --> 09:36.870
And here we provide two inputs.

09:36.870 --> 09:41.350
The first input is the variable that we want to append.

09:41.350 --> 09:49.750
And then the second input is the information that we want to put at the end of the of this list or this

09:49.750 --> 09:50.110
array.

09:50.550 --> 09:50.830
Okay.

09:50.870 --> 09:55.710
So now we see that this array starts off as being empty here.

09:55.990 --> 09:59.150
And then what's printed out is actually when I equals zero.

09:59.150 --> 10:01.230
So the first iteration of this for loop.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.630
Now this loop is getting longer and longer.

10:04.110 --> 10:04.430
Okay.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.990
So conclusions from this video.

10:07.270 --> 10:12.070
Uh, you can initialize variables, especially in numpy.

10:12.670 --> 10:19.810
Uh, you do not always need to initialize variables because you can allow variables to grow in size

10:19.810 --> 10:21.210
inside a for loop.

10:21.490 --> 10:29.330
Nonetheless, initialization using this kind of approach either with numpy or numpy dot zeros.

10:30.530 --> 10:35.530
This is much better than letting your arrays grow inside for loops.

10:35.530 --> 10:37.290
It's better for memory reasons.

10:37.290 --> 10:40.770
This is more memory intensive than this approach.

10:41.450 --> 10:49.770
It's better for computation time reason because this is faster than growing an array.

10:49.810 --> 10:55.330
So especially if you have large arrays, this is going to take really long time.

10:55.570 --> 10:58.850
And it's also better just for you to think about your code.

10:59.010 --> 11:07.210
Because if you can already plan in advance how big your arrays and matrices need to be, that means

11:07.210 --> 11:12.490
that you are thinking critically about what's going on in your code, and that is always a good idea.

11:12.770 --> 11:16.370
Nonetheless, appending is also sometimes useful.
