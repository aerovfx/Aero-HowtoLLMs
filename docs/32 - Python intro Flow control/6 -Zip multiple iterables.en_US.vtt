00:01.960 --> 00:05.120
So I have written out these two lists here.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.640
I call this variable number list because it's all numbers.

00:08.640 --> 00:12.320
And this variable letter list obviously because it's all letters.

00:12.760 --> 00:18.160
Now let's say we want to associate each of these numbers with a letter.

00:18.160 --> 00:23.920
So now I'm just doing this with spaces so you can see how they are visually aligned.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.720
And now let's say we want to print them together.

00:26.880 --> 00:35.800
So what we can do is something like for I in range length number number list like this.

00:35.800 --> 00:44.000
And then I can print out letter list I and then number list I again.

00:44.040 --> 00:48.120
So far this is all code that you know how to run.

00:48.160 --> 00:52.440
And you can interpret based on what you've learned in previous videos.

00:52.680 --> 00:56.840
So here we have the D and the three and the E and the five and so on.

00:56.880 --> 01:01.480
Now there's nothing wrong with writing out a for loop like this.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.280
This is great.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.680
It's perfectly fine.

01:03.880 --> 01:04.800
It's legal.

01:04.840 --> 01:05.280
It's.

01:05.520 --> 01:07.270
But we can do better than that.

01:07.310 --> 01:07.790
Okay.

01:08.030 --> 01:13.390
And the way that we're going to do better than that is by using the zip function.

01:13.550 --> 01:14.990
So let's see how this works.

01:14.990 --> 01:22.270
So for I'm going to call this numb and let in zip number list.

01:22.670 --> 01:24.270
Uh number list.

01:24.830 --> 01:26.030
Letter list.

01:26.030 --> 01:26.870
Like this.

01:26.870 --> 01:30.310
And now I'm going to print out numb comma let okay.

01:30.550 --> 01:34.590
And now here we get actually the reverse order because I put the numbers first.

01:35.710 --> 01:35.990
Okay.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.910
And here I printed out the letters first.

01:38.270 --> 01:41.110
Uh, so uh yeah we get the same.

01:41.150 --> 01:41.670
Well okay.

01:41.670 --> 01:42.830
Let me do it like this.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.990
Now we're really going to get the same result.

01:46.270 --> 01:53.070
Okay, so now instead of having to write out the entire variable name and index into that variable,

01:53.550 --> 02:03.190
we are just going to zip these and use this zip object as the iterable to get out the value at each

02:03.190 --> 02:08.190
element in the number list, and the value at each element in the letter list.

02:08.190 --> 02:17.050
So I think you can see that these two for loops accomplish the same goal, but this one is more compact.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.330
By the way, note the order here.

02:19.330 --> 02:25.210
So whatever variable you put in first that is going to be assigned to this variable here.

02:25.210 --> 02:34.810
So for example, if I were to write letter list and then number list, now it's it's going to be the

02:34.810 --> 02:35.170
reverse.

02:35.170 --> 02:36.410
And this is confusing right.

02:36.410 --> 02:40.090
Because the variable num actually corresponds to the letters.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.810
And the variable let corresponds to the numbers.

02:42.810 --> 02:50.050
So in some sense it's arbitrary what order you put the variables in here into the zip function.

02:50.210 --> 02:56.850
But you do want to be mindful that the order in which you enter the variables into the zip function

02:56.850 --> 03:02.850
makes sense with the order that you have in the for loop here and here I'm only using two variables,

03:02.850 --> 03:05.650
but you are actually not limited to using two variables.

03:05.650 --> 03:08.370
You can also have three variables.

03:08.370 --> 03:10.650
Maybe I would call this w for word.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.010
Okay.

03:11.050 --> 03:13.170
Now this variable doesn't exist.

03:13.170 --> 03:16.010
So we get a little red squiggly underline thing.

03:16.010 --> 03:23.200
But this is just to illustrate that if you will zip up three variables, then you're going to have three

03:23.200 --> 03:25.920
outputs like this in the for loop.

03:25.960 --> 03:26.200
Okay.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.240
So let me go back and get rid of that.

03:29.560 --> 03:34.800
There are two more concepts that I would like to introduce you to in this video.

03:35.120 --> 03:42.120
One is combining what you learned in the previous video about enumerate with what you just learned here

03:42.120 --> 03:43.120
about zip.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.320
So let me copy and paste this code.

03:46.640 --> 03:53.240
And now I'm going to encase this zip object inside an enumerate function.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.000
So this is starting to get really thick code here.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
This is starting to get into some advanced Python coding.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.040
And then I'm going to have this variable here called idx.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.040
Now here's the thing.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.760
Enumerate provides two outputs.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.920
It always gives two variables as outputs.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.680
The first variable is the index.

04:14.800 --> 04:20.880
And the second variable is whatever is the iterator inside the enumerate function.

04:21.280 --> 04:25.580
But what is the the iterator inside the enumerate function.

04:25.580 --> 04:32.740
In this case, it's a zip object that itself contains two variables, so we need to use parentheses

04:32.740 --> 04:41.860
to group together these two variables, which are the output of of zip, and then as one object together

04:41.860 --> 04:45.140
as this tuple that is the second output of enumerate.

04:45.460 --> 04:46.700
I hope that makes sense.

04:46.700 --> 04:51.620
I know it's a little bit confusing, but, uh, yeah, that's, uh, that's Python for you.

04:52.140 --> 04:56.700
Okay, so here I have oops, not I, I like this okay.

04:56.740 --> 04:59.940
So here we have the index and here we have the letter.

04:59.940 --> 05:01.380
And here we have the number.

05:01.540 --> 05:08.660
And you know this would be useful if you want to create a new variable let's say ID equals I don't know

05:08.700 --> 05:10.860
num to the power of eight.

05:10.900 --> 05:19.860
Let's say okay now I'm going to initialize this to be zeros of length number list like this.

05:19.860 --> 05:23.100
And then we can examine this v variable.

05:23.300 --> 05:27.100
Uh sorry zeros like this okay.

05:27.260 --> 05:32.330
So we're printing out the index and then the letter and the number.

05:32.330 --> 05:34.650
And this comes from enumerate.

05:34.650 --> 05:36.890
And these two come from zip.

05:37.090 --> 05:44.450
And then I'm using that index as a way to populate this new variable based on some calculation that

05:44.450 --> 05:48.610
I'm performing on some of the variables that I have zipped up here.

05:49.210 --> 05:57.810
The last concept that I want to introduce in this video is using zip to create a dictionary.

05:57.810 --> 06:01.730
So you learned about dictionaries in the previous section.

06:01.730 --> 06:08.250
And dictionaries are used a lot in Python coding, but in particular in large language models.

06:08.250 --> 06:11.530
You'll see dictionaries used a lot in this course.

06:11.930 --> 06:12.290
Okay.

06:12.330 --> 06:16.130
So here I'm going to make a variable names.

06:16.130 --> 06:20.330
And this is going to be a list alpha beta gamma.

06:20.770 --> 06:24.130
And here is going to be values.

06:24.130 --> 06:29.810
And that's let's say ten and 20 and 40 like this okay.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.610
These happen to correspond to numbers.

06:32.610 --> 06:39.910
These are frequencies in Hertz, and those correspond to the brainwaves that are often observed in neuroscience.

06:39.910 --> 06:43.910
So ten hertz or ten cycles per second is called the alpha band.

06:44.150 --> 06:47.950
20 cycles per second is called the beta band and 40 for gamma.

06:48.110 --> 06:50.830
Okay, let's say we want to create a dictionary.

06:51.070 --> 06:56.670
We can write dict and then zip names and values.

06:56.830 --> 06:58.310
And let's see what D is.

06:58.550 --> 06:59.030
Okay.

06:59.150 --> 07:07.430
So now we have zipped these two variables together and put that inside a dict function.

07:07.550 --> 07:14.870
And what this does is create a dictionary where the first element, the first variable in zip becomes

07:14.870 --> 07:20.910
the keys, and the second variable inside zip becomes the values.

07:21.070 --> 07:26.990
So now we can access each of these values using for example beta to get 20.

07:27.030 --> 07:31.070
So as you learned a few videos ago in the previous section.

07:31.470 --> 07:32.110
So there you go.

07:32.150 --> 07:34.830
Now you've learned about the zip function.

07:34.830 --> 07:39.990
It is a little bit more advanced Python coding, but it's quite handy.
