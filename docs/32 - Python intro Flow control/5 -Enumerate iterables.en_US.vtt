00:02.880 --> 00:05.680
I will begin by writing out a for loop.

00:05.680 --> 00:12.120
That is perfectly fine syntactically, but then I'm going to show you a better way to write the same

00:12.120 --> 00:12.960
for loop.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.640
Okay, so let's write.

00:14.680 --> 00:18.760
Let's create some numbers equals numpy dot linspace.

00:18.760 --> 00:22.880
Let's go from minus five to plus 5 in 7 digits.

00:22.880 --> 00:27.560
So this is just some numbers just an array for us to work with okay.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.800
So let's say we want to print out these numbers in a for loop.

00:31.920 --> 00:38.480
We can do something like this I in range length of some numbers.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.480
And then what do we want to do.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.840
I'm going to print out index.

00:46.120 --> 00:53.920
And then string I plus has a value plus string.

00:54.520 --> 01:00.680
String some numbers I like this okay.

01:01.040 --> 01:06.950
So here's what we do for I in And then we want a range iterator variable.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.430
But how long does this need to be.

01:09.510 --> 01:15.630
Well I'm just setting it to be whatever is the length of this variable here and here I define that to

01:15.670 --> 01:16.430
be seven.

01:16.830 --> 01:17.070
Okay.

01:17.110 --> 01:24.790
And then I'm printing out the index number and the value of the array at that index.

01:24.830 --> 01:25.190
Okay.

01:25.230 --> 01:25.910
Very nice.

01:25.910 --> 01:29.950
So I hope everything in here is understandable to you.

01:30.230 --> 01:38.310
What I'm going to do now is use a a new iterator type that I haven't yet introduced you to called enumerate.

01:38.390 --> 01:45.190
So for I comma n in enumerate some numbers.

01:45.830 --> 01:46.150
Okay.

01:46.190 --> 01:49.430
So notice a couple of similarities and differences.

01:50.430 --> 01:56.670
We still have the for the in and the iterator and we still have the colon.

01:56.670 --> 02:02.270
So at some basic syntactic level it looks similar to setting up this for loop.

02:02.670 --> 02:09.930
But there is two key differences one This function, this reserved keyword function enumerate which

02:09.930 --> 02:12.050
comes from to number something.

02:12.410 --> 02:17.090
And then here I have two variables instead of just one variable okay.

02:17.130 --> 02:20.730
And now I can write print index.

02:20.730 --> 02:23.090
And now I'm also going to set this up slightly differently.

02:23.090 --> 02:27.490
So instead of using plus signs I'm going to just use commas I.

02:29.530 --> 02:32.770
Has value n okay.

02:32.810 --> 02:36.010
So here you can see we get exactly the same output.

02:36.210 --> 02:40.330
In both cases this is a little bit more condensed.

02:40.570 --> 02:44.450
Partly it's more condensed because I just set up the string printing differently from here.

02:44.450 --> 02:45.930
But that's not the important part.

02:46.290 --> 02:55.810
The important part is that this variable n is actually the value of each element in this list over here

02:55.850 --> 02:57.810
or in this numpy array here.

02:58.050 --> 02:59.330
So I hope that makes sense.

02:59.330 --> 03:04.370
So enumerate provides two variables that we can use in a for loop.

03:04.570 --> 03:14.120
The first variable is an index and the second variable is the value in each of the elements in at that

03:14.120 --> 03:14.800
index.

03:14.840 --> 03:15.080
Okay.

03:15.120 --> 03:22.760
So now instead of writing out some numbers and then index I, I can simply write out n over here.

03:22.880 --> 03:28.080
I hope you agree that this is more convenient and more compact okay.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.480
So this is with numbers.

03:29.480 --> 03:33.320
Now I want to show you an example using letters.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.960
So let's write a text and I'm going to write.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.720
Hello my name is Mike.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.560
Imagine me yelling this in a crowd okay.

03:42.160 --> 03:47.640
So now what I want to do is just find all of the vowels in this text.

03:47.960 --> 03:54.560
So I'm going to write for I comma l in enumerate text.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.320
And let me just first print out I and l.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.720
So you see what this looks like.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.600
So here we have all of the indices.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.640
In the first column it goes zero through 20.

04:04.640 --> 04:08.320
Because there happened to be 21 elements in this text.

04:08.320 --> 04:18.830
We can also confirm this here the length of text is 21, and then L is the value of this variable at

04:18.830 --> 04:21.830
each of the indices corresponding to I.

04:22.070 --> 04:22.790
So then you see.

04:22.790 --> 04:23.150
Hello.

04:23.190 --> 04:24.710
This is a space here.

04:24.830 --> 04:26.470
My name is Mike.

04:26.510 --> 04:26.830
Okay.

04:26.870 --> 04:27.590
Very nice.

04:27.710 --> 04:31.630
So how can we tell if we have a vowel in here.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.750
Well we can do something like this.

04:33.750 --> 04:38.030
So for l in actually, I haven't yet introduced this kind of syntax.

04:38.190 --> 04:43.230
Let's say uh eh in uh, e like this.

04:43.470 --> 04:52.030
So what Python is doing with this syntax is asking or searching for whether the value of this variable

04:52.070 --> 04:56.510
here is anywhere inside of of this string here.

04:56.910 --> 04:59.870
So is a inside this string.

04:59.870 --> 05:00.910
And the answer is no.

05:00.910 --> 05:02.910
So we get an output of false.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.150
And we can just add an A in here.

05:05.150 --> 05:07.310
And now we get an answer of true.

05:07.590 --> 05:09.870
We can do this also with a number.

05:09.870 --> 05:14.290
So for in let's say A12, three, five.

05:14.330 --> 05:15.770
Here the answer is false.

05:15.890 --> 05:17.970
And now I can change this to be three.

05:17.970 --> 05:19.530
And here the answer is true.

05:20.610 --> 05:20.810
Okay.

05:20.850 --> 05:29.050
So with that in mind I'm going to say if l in a e I o u then.

05:29.050 --> 05:36.450
So if this is true, if this letter is in this vowel then I'm just going to print out l like this.

05:36.930 --> 05:37.250
Okay.

05:37.290 --> 05:39.370
So here we see a e.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.530
So this is hello my name is.

05:42.530 --> 05:45.890
But then I don't see any I or E in here.

05:45.930 --> 05:46.130
Right.

05:46.170 --> 05:49.650
Because this is capital and these are not capital.

05:49.930 --> 05:51.410
So how can we fix this.

05:51.410 --> 05:58.170
How can we also get this to recognize that we want capital letters as well as lowercase letters.

05:58.970 --> 06:02.970
One way you could do this obviously would just be to repeat like this.

06:03.130 --> 06:07.130
So then we have capitals and lowercase letters.

06:07.130 --> 06:12.290
But we can also use a method on a string called lower.

06:12.650 --> 06:14.690
So let me introduce you to this.

06:14.850 --> 06:20.080
So here I have a Qwerty and then yeah this is just a Qwerty.

06:20.080 --> 06:25.960
And then if I right lower then we get the lowercase version of these letters.

06:26.360 --> 06:26.720
Okay.

06:26.760 --> 06:34.840
So this means we are ignoring the capitalization because every character here, every value of L is

06:34.840 --> 06:36.560
going to be lowercase.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.080
Okay.

06:37.120 --> 06:41.040
So then we can print this again and we get the capital letters coming out here.

06:41.720 --> 06:51.240
The last thing I want to do in this video is create a numeric vector that is zeros for non vowels and

06:51.240 --> 06:54.160
ones whenever we have a vowel in this text.

06:54.320 --> 07:02.440
So I'll call this variable vowels and I will initialize it to be zeros of the length of text.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.280
Okay.

07:03.320 --> 07:12.200
And now I'm going to replace this print command with vowels I equals one okay.

07:12.240 --> 07:15.480
And this is basically why I wanted to use enumerate.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.380
If you didn't need the index then it would be better.

07:18.420 --> 07:21.540
Let me do show this.

07:21.660 --> 07:26.980
So if we didn't need the index, then it would actually be better just to remove this altogether.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.740
And then we can have print l like this.

07:30.780 --> 07:31.020
Okay.

07:31.060 --> 07:33.060
So this accomplishes the same goal.

07:33.300 --> 07:40.340
The main reason why I wanted to use enumerate in this for this example is because I want to create this

07:40.700 --> 07:47.140
numpy array here, which is all zeros where there's no vowels and ones where there are vowels.

07:47.580 --> 07:47.980
Okay.

07:48.020 --> 07:50.740
So then we can just print this out like this.

07:51.220 --> 07:56.660
So now we have an array of numbers that is the same size as the text.

07:57.020 --> 07:59.300
And it has a value of zero.

07:59.500 --> 08:05.140
Wherever we don't have a vowel and a value of one wherever we do have a vowel and it doesn't matter

08:05.140 --> 08:08.180
if it's uppercase or lowercase.

08:08.460 --> 08:09.220
Very nice.

08:09.220 --> 08:12.300
So that is your introduction to enumerate.

08:12.300 --> 08:19.300
We are going to continue using enumerate in the next video when I also introduce you to the zip function.
