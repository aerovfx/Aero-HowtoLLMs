00:01.560 --> 00:05.200
Now I will introduce you to if statements.

00:05.200 --> 00:12.480
If statements are perhaps the easiest of the coding control flow statements to understand.

00:12.640 --> 00:19.000
And that's because if statements are the kinds of constructions that we use every day in our lives.

00:19.160 --> 00:23.040
So for example, if I'm thirsty, then I will drink some water.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.600
If it's raining out, then I will stay home and watch Futurama.

00:26.600 --> 00:30.680
Whatever are the if then statements that you use in your normal life.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.840
It works the same way in Python.

00:33.080 --> 00:36.960
So we start off with if that's the key statement, you can see.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.640
Again, it's a reserved keyword.

00:39.040 --> 00:44.080
And then there needs to be some statement that can evaluate to true or false.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.600
So in this case I'm just writing out the word true.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.720
The boolean true.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.760
So obviously this is always going to be true.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.360
True is always going to be true.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.000
And then uh again we see a colon.

00:57.200 --> 01:05.150
And then we have two spaces and all of the text that appears after the, uh, the if statement after

01:05.150 --> 01:10.830
the colon and is indented is part of the if statement.

01:10.870 --> 01:11.190
Okay.

01:11.230 --> 01:12.710
So done.

01:14.190 --> 01:14.950
So now we see.

01:14.990 --> 01:15.230
Hi.

01:15.270 --> 01:15.550
Done.

01:15.550 --> 01:17.790
Now I'm going to change this to be false.

01:18.590 --> 01:20.030
False correctly spelled.

01:20.150 --> 01:29.830
So now Python will say if this conditional is true then I run everything else in the if statement all

01:29.830 --> 01:33.550
the way up until we get back to spaces before.

01:34.110 --> 01:34.390
Okay.

01:34.430 --> 01:36.350
And now I only see the word done.

01:36.350 --> 01:37.830
I don't see the word hi.

01:37.830 --> 01:40.070
And why do I not see the word hi?

01:40.110 --> 01:41.990
Because this is false.

01:41.990 --> 01:43.230
It never activated.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.710
Okay, so this word here true or false?

01:46.710 --> 01:49.670
This is the conditional of an if statement.

01:49.670 --> 01:54.710
It needs to be some statement that evaluates to a boolean true or false.

01:54.710 --> 01:59.150
So it can be something like testing for equality here.

01:59.340 --> 02:01.940
This is going to evaluate to false.

02:02.340 --> 02:02.740
Okay.

02:02.780 --> 02:08.140
So let's try something else here I will actually I'll put this in this code cell I'm going to generate

02:08.180 --> 02:09.140
a number.

02:09.260 --> 02:11.340
This is going to be a random number.

02:11.540 --> 02:18.500
And it's going to be somewhere between uh well it's just going to be a random Gaussian number with an

02:18.500 --> 02:20.460
expected average of zero.

02:20.580 --> 02:23.860
And it can take on positive and negative numbers.

02:23.900 --> 02:24.180
Okay.

02:24.220 --> 02:26.140
So here's just a bunch of random numbers.

02:26.580 --> 02:30.340
And now what I'm going to do is test whether this is positive.

02:30.340 --> 02:33.300
So if num is greater than zero.

02:34.140 --> 02:37.980
And then I'm going to print the print the number.

02:37.980 --> 02:39.500
So very simple okay.

02:39.540 --> 02:41.540
So what's going to happen when I run this code.

02:41.540 --> 02:44.220
You may have seen me deleting something.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.700
And what do you think will happen when I run this code.

02:47.260 --> 02:48.980
It's going to give an error.

02:48.980 --> 02:50.780
And why is it going to give an error.

02:50.940 --> 02:54.980
Well it says actually very clearly it expected a colon.

02:55.020 --> 02:55.500
Okay.

02:55.660 --> 03:00.210
And just to make sure this is also really clear here, I just manually put in two spaces here.

03:00.570 --> 03:02.330
Run the code again and again.

03:02.330 --> 03:04.450
I get the same error message here.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.770
So you really need that colon here.

03:07.810 --> 03:08.290
Okay.

03:08.570 --> 03:11.690
So now I'm going to keep running this multiple times here.

03:11.730 --> 03:16.050
There's no output because the number happened to be negative purely by chance.

03:16.690 --> 03:17.090
Okay.

03:17.290 --> 03:21.490
And whenever it's positive it's going to print out the random number.

03:22.490 --> 03:26.970
Now what if we also wanted to know what the number was when it's negative.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.530
So you can think of doing something like this.

03:29.570 --> 03:33.530
If num is negative then print num.

03:33.770 --> 03:36.370
But this is kind of okay.

03:36.410 --> 03:40.410
But it's not really the best way to deal with this situation.

03:40.570 --> 03:44.890
What we are going to add here is something called an else statement.

03:44.890 --> 03:49.610
So if this is true then run this code.

03:49.810 --> 03:54.290
But if this is false then run this code.

03:55.050 --> 03:55.330
Okay.

03:55.370 --> 04:01.040
Again this is your typical if else statement that you would use in the real world.

04:01.800 --> 04:07.320
And maybe I will say right this positive position positive like this.

04:07.560 --> 04:11.080
And here is going to be negative like this.

04:11.400 --> 04:11.680
Okay.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.560
So now you see we're always getting some output.

04:14.800 --> 04:21.960
And yeah the question is whether it's this being printed depending on whether this evaluates to true

04:21.960 --> 04:30.160
or this, uh, this being run when this expression here this conditional evaluates to false.

04:30.360 --> 04:37.880
The next concept in if statements that I would like to introduce you to is called conjunctive conditionals.

04:37.880 --> 04:44.440
That's where we are testing not only for one expression to be true or false, but multiple expressions.

04:44.600 --> 04:52.520
So for example, I can write if four equals four and uh one is less than three, then I'll print.

04:52.520 --> 04:52.840
Uh.

04:53.000 --> 04:53.400
Yeah.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.000
Both conditions are true.

04:57.030 --> 05:00.270
And otherwise I'm going to print.

05:02.230 --> 05:05.870
At least one condition is false.

05:06.310 --> 05:07.230
Like this.

05:07.270 --> 05:10.350
Okay, so now Python is going to see this.

05:10.350 --> 05:13.350
And word again reserved keyword.

05:13.510 --> 05:19.630
And it says that I will run this code only if this is true.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.550
And this is also true.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.710
So for example I can change this to five.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.230
And now this is true.

05:27.230 --> 05:28.630
So one is less than three.

05:28.630 --> 05:30.750
But this is not true.

05:30.750 --> 05:35.030
And that means that this entire expression becomes false.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.910
So I can just run that over here.

05:37.110 --> 05:40.710
So four equals five and one less than three.

05:40.750 --> 05:41.910
That is false.

05:42.070 --> 05:46.030
But there's another reserved conditional keyword called or.

05:46.390 --> 05:48.270
And now this ends up being true.

05:48.270 --> 05:49.390
And why is this true.

05:49.550 --> 05:54.390
Because when we use or we're asking for whether this one or this one.

05:54.390 --> 05:58.150
So at least one conditional must be true.

05:58.150 --> 06:04.790
So if I would replace this with or and now this message is is no longer accurate.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.030
But that's okay.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.230
But it did run.

06:07.230 --> 06:11.110
So you now understand that at least one of these is true.

06:11.110 --> 06:12.470
I'll set that back to end.

06:13.350 --> 06:21.710
The last thing I want to introduce you to in this video is embedding an if statement inside a for loop.

06:21.990 --> 06:26.310
But first I need to introduce you to the modulus operator.

06:26.310 --> 06:28.870
That's the percent sign in Python.

06:29.030 --> 06:34.150
And it gives us the modulus which is also called the remainder in math.

06:34.270 --> 06:40.310
So for example if we were to divide five by two well you know that answer is 2.5.

06:40.350 --> 06:45.550
But we can also say that the answer is two with a remainder of one.

06:45.830 --> 06:46.070
Right.

06:46.110 --> 06:49.430
Because two times two gives us four.

06:49.750 --> 06:53.350
And then to get up to five we have a remainder of one okay.

06:53.390 --> 06:56.060
So we can write 5% Two.

06:56.580 --> 07:00.820
In Python speak you would call this mod or modulus or modulo.

07:01.060 --> 07:02.820
And that gives us one.

07:02.820 --> 07:04.300
And what does this number mean?

07:04.540 --> 07:09.780
This number means that two goes into five any number of times any.

07:09.820 --> 07:16.820
You know, this operation doesn't tell us how many times two goes into five, but two goes into five

07:16.820 --> 07:18.580
with a remainder of one.

07:18.580 --> 07:20.060
And that's what this tells us.

07:20.540 --> 07:27.020
Now you can use the modulus operator for lots of different things, but one of the applications that

07:27.020 --> 07:32.980
it's most commonly used for is to determine whether a number is even or odd.

07:33.220 --> 07:41.420
And that's because all odd numbers have a modulus of one when dividing by two, and all even numbers

07:41.420 --> 07:44.260
have a modulus of zero when dividing by two.

07:44.460 --> 07:48.820
So let's look at this I'm going to write numpy dot arrange ten.

07:48.820 --> 07:52.140
So this is just numbers from zero up to nine.

07:52.140 --> 07:53.700
Actually maybe let's go up to ten.

07:54.020 --> 07:56.450
And now mod two like this.

07:56.450 --> 07:59.330
So this is 0101 actually.

07:59.370 --> 08:01.570
Okay, maybe let me do it this way.

08:01.610 --> 08:08.810
Print like this and then print numpy dot a range.

08:11.170 --> 08:13.570
Of 11 mod two.

08:13.610 --> 08:21.050
Like this okay so here we see the spacing isn't perfectly aligned here but the numbers go uh zero.

08:21.250 --> 08:25.890
And then we have an odd number, an even number, an odd number, an even number, and so on.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.610
And here we have ones for.

08:28.730 --> 08:36.570
So in the uh, the modulus, we have ones for all of the odd numbers and zeros for all of the even numbers.

08:36.850 --> 08:42.130
So this is a way to determine whether a given number is even or odd.

08:42.290 --> 08:42.610
Okay.

08:42.650 --> 08:47.450
So with all of that as background let's write a for loop and an if statement.

08:47.450 --> 08:52.090
So for n in range let's go up to I don't know how about 20.

08:52.850 --> 09:05.160
And uh so now what I'm going to write is if n mod two equals zero, print that the string of this number

09:06.080 --> 09:08.560
is an even number.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.600
And then I'm just highlighting this and copying it else.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.600
This is an odd number.

09:15.800 --> 09:16.120
Okay.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.000
So now we get zero.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.840
So actually this is a question in math whether zero is an even or an odd number.

09:22.840 --> 09:26.880
Maybe to avoid that annoying ambiguity we can just start at one.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.080
One is an odd number, two is an even number.

09:30.080 --> 09:35.360
And so on, all the way up to 19 because I wrote the number 20 over here.

09:35.960 --> 09:36.520
Very good.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.880
So what you see here.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.280
So you learned about the modulus operator.

09:40.280 --> 09:46.160
And you also learned about embedding control statements inside other control statements.

09:46.160 --> 09:52.040
So I have an if else statement that is embedded inside this for loop.
