00:01.720 --> 00:06.280
In this video you will learn about another type of variable.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.760
This one is called a boolean.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.960
It's named after a logician and statistician named Boole.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.120
Okay, so a boolean is very, very simple.

00:17.120 --> 00:22.200
It's the basis of many fundamental circuits and logic gates.

00:22.200 --> 00:29.800
And basically a Boolean variable can only take on one of two values true or false, which is sometimes

00:29.800 --> 00:32.680
numerically coded as 1 or 0.

00:33.200 --> 00:38.600
There are reserved keywords in Python for Boolean expressions.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.560
So in particular we have true.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.320
Now notice that the font here is black.

00:43.480 --> 00:47.960
And now when I type true it turns into a blue okay.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.400
So I can run this code.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.680
And it tells me that true is true.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.400
And of course there's also another one for false.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.880
And false is false.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.120
Now notice the capitalization here.

00:58.120 --> 01:00.000
So this becomes blue.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.030
And that was a reserved keyword.

01:04.030 --> 01:07.710
If I would write out true like this, then it remains black.

01:07.710 --> 01:10.990
And if I run this, I get an error because true is not defined.

01:11.310 --> 01:16.870
And if I use all caps, then also we get an error that true is not defined.

01:16.870 --> 01:23.110
So this is not a variable that Python recognizes because we haven't defined it to be anything.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.190
So I can create a variable.

01:25.190 --> 01:28.070
I can say true equals 7.4.

01:28.310 --> 01:30.950
Now this is fine I have a variable called true.

01:31.310 --> 01:35.310
But that is different from this true.

01:35.550 --> 01:43.710
And here we also get an error because as I've mentioned this is a reserved special term in Python.

01:43.710 --> 01:49.790
So we cannot say we cannot use this as a variable name like any other variable name.

01:50.190 --> 01:50.590
Okay.

01:50.630 --> 01:54.030
So we have true and we have false.

01:54.350 --> 01:55.830
And what do we do with these.

01:55.830 --> 02:00.230
Well these can also be the result of a comparison.

02:00.430 --> 02:06.260
So if we want to know if two variables are equal to each other.

02:06.260 --> 02:12.980
Perhaps this is two outcomes of two different operations, and we want to know if the impact of these

02:12.980 --> 02:14.860
two operations was the same.

02:15.140 --> 02:18.380
We can use a double equal sign like this.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.100
So now we get the answer of true.

02:21.420 --> 02:27.500
Now notice this is very different from a single equal sign that we use to create assignments.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.900
That and that's what we were doing previously like here creating a list.

02:30.900 --> 02:34.380
And we assign this list into this variable.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.020
That is one equal sign.

02:36.540 --> 02:40.580
What we are doing here is saying using two equal signs.

02:40.940 --> 02:47.260
And here you can think of the difference as saying four equals four.

02:47.260 --> 02:48.660
So this is an assignment.

02:48.660 --> 02:51.340
This is a statement that we are making.

02:51.700 --> 02:57.140
And then with a double equal sign like this we're not making a statement.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.980
We're asking a question.

02:58.980 --> 03:01.660
So this is a question we are asking Python.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.370
Are these two things equal to each other?

03:04.770 --> 03:05.130
Well, okay.

03:05.170 --> 03:08.690
Without the question mark, that's not going to be valid Python code.

03:08.930 --> 03:13.970
But essentially here we are asking a question and the answer is yes.

03:13.970 --> 03:15.090
These two are equal.

03:15.250 --> 03:21.290
And you know you can differentiate that from uh equals uh double equals 4.1.

03:21.290 --> 03:25.810
And now we are asking the question does four equal 4.1.

03:25.930 --> 03:27.570
And the answer is false.

03:27.570 --> 03:31.810
These are not equal to each other okay.

03:31.850 --> 03:33.890
Now here is an interesting question.

03:34.090 --> 03:40.610
I would like you to guess whether the answer to this expression is going to be true or false.

03:40.610 --> 03:41.850
I haven't run the code yet.

03:41.890 --> 03:43.050
This ignore this.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.970
This is from the previous run.

03:45.290 --> 03:48.890
The question is, uh, are these two expressions equal?

03:48.890 --> 03:54.650
Now, you already know from a previous video that, uh, they have different data types.

03:54.650 --> 03:57.970
This is of type int and this is of type float.

03:58.050 --> 04:03.200
So the question is whether Python will tell us that these two are equal or unequal.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.120
And if you like to pause the video, make a guess.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.440
You can try this yourself.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.680
And now we are going to find that they are true.

04:10.680 --> 04:11.720
So what does this mean?

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
Well, this tells us that Python actually has some flexibility built in.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.240
So although these are technically distinct from each other because they have different data types,

04:23.600 --> 04:32.160
Python actually is flexible enough to recognize that they are the same, even though the types are different.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.120
Okay.

04:33.240 --> 04:37.160
That said, you know we can try type A are the types the same?

04:38.040 --> 04:41.480
And here the answer is going to be false because this is type int.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.240
And this is type float.

04:44.000 --> 04:44.440
Okay.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.880
So let me see.

04:45.920 --> 04:46.800
Now we have.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.320
So I showed you equals.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.960
And this gives us a boolean result.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.280
We can also do comparisons using the less than and greater than signs.

04:56.520 --> 05:00.400
So here's a question is four greater than five.

05:00.520 --> 05:06.310
And the answer to that is no or false is for less than five.

05:06.550 --> 05:08.150
And the answer to that is true.

05:08.430 --> 05:10.110
Here's another interesting question.

05:10.230 --> 05:13.190
For less than four is four less than four?

05:13.910 --> 05:18.750
No it isn't, but is for less than or equal to four.

05:19.030 --> 05:20.630
Here the answer is yes.

05:20.630 --> 05:24.310
This it's not less than four, but it is equal to four.

05:24.590 --> 05:31.990
So when we combine these two symbols less than or equal to, then we get an answer of true.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.150
Okay.

05:33.190 --> 05:36.270
Now I'm going to show you conjunctive comparisons.

05:36.270 --> 05:38.310
So here is one comparison.

05:38.510 --> 05:43.030
We are comparing what's on the left side to what's on the right side.

05:43.350 --> 05:47.790
So let's do let's make this be 14 greater than four.

05:48.150 --> 05:50.350
And here obviously the answer is true.

05:50.870 --> 05:52.630
And we want to know.

05:52.630 --> 05:55.590
So let me I'm going to do some spacing here.

05:55.630 --> 06:00.950
So is 14 greater than four and is seven less than ten.

06:01.470 --> 06:03.110
So here the answer is true.

06:03.110 --> 06:04.250
And why is the answer true?

06:04.250 --> 06:08.650
Because this part is true and this part is also true.

06:08.970 --> 06:12.170
But how about if I say seven greater than ten?

06:12.570 --> 06:14.050
Here the answer is false.

06:14.050 --> 06:15.850
And why is this answer false?

06:16.010 --> 06:21.410
Well, you know this part is true, but we're looking for an and and this part is false.

06:21.690 --> 06:21.970
Okay.

06:22.010 --> 06:23.650
So there's also or.

06:24.530 --> 06:26.210
So here the answer is true.

06:26.210 --> 06:27.610
And why is the answer true here.

06:27.610 --> 06:32.850
Because we want to know whether this part is true or this part is true.

06:32.890 --> 06:38.530
So if one of them is false and one of them is true, the answer is still going to be true.

06:38.770 --> 06:41.250
If one of them or both of them are false.

06:41.250 --> 06:42.810
So let's do this.

06:43.290 --> 06:44.970
Then we get an answer of false.

06:44.970 --> 06:47.650
And of course, if both are true, then that's also fine.

06:49.050 --> 06:55.170
Here I also want to show you the application of parentheses and spacing.

06:55.610 --> 06:56.090
Okay.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.730
So we can run this again.

06:57.770 --> 07:03.130
Now this also worked before I had the parentheses in there.

07:03.250 --> 07:09.960
So this is a case where the parentheses are not strictly necessary for the code.

07:10.160 --> 07:14.800
But they do help visually interpret what this line of code means.

07:14.960 --> 07:21.360
And that is especially true in combination with spacing, because you know you can space like this.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.040
And to me this looks a little bit confusing.

07:25.040 --> 07:30.280
This is harder to interpret, even though for the code it's fine for the Python interpreter.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.760
You know, this is also fine.

07:32.120 --> 07:41.320
Uh, so this is, you know, um, unnecessary parentheses can often be useful in code, and I recommend

07:41.320 --> 07:48.680
adding parentheses to visually group different pieces of code, even if it's not strictly necessary

07:48.680 --> 07:50.720
for the Python code to run.

07:51.320 --> 07:58.680
One more concept I would like to cover in this video is assigning variables to be booleans, so I can

07:58.680 --> 07:59.720
have a variable.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.840
Let's call this outcome and that equals true.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.440
So here we go.

08:04.440 --> 08:10.030
All I'm doing is assigning this value of true to this variable outcome.

08:10.030 --> 08:13.270
And we can see what is the type of this variable.

08:13.510 --> 08:15.030
It is of type bool.

08:15.390 --> 08:15.710
Okay.

08:15.750 --> 08:19.310
So now you know several different types of variables in Python.

08:19.310 --> 08:21.510
You know ints for integers.

08:21.510 --> 08:23.830
You know floats for floating point numbers.

08:23.830 --> 08:30.470
Basically any number with a decimal point you know about lists and now you know about booleans or type

08:30.510 --> 08:31.030
bool.

08:31.350 --> 08:33.550
A string is another one you know about.

08:33.550 --> 08:39.510
So you can see you're already building up quite a lot of knowledge about different variable types.

08:40.670 --> 08:40.910
Okay.

08:40.910 --> 08:41.430
Let's see.

08:41.550 --> 08:48.550
Um, these can be a little bit confusing when we assign operations to the outcome.

08:48.550 --> 08:54.430
So for example, if we want to say uh four equal maybe let's do something else.

08:54.430 --> 09:03.870
How about this I will say um x equals two and y equals two squared.

09:04.310 --> 09:04.550
Okay.

09:04.590 --> 09:10.260
So I'll run this code to create these variables or overwrite them actually because I created them earlier.

09:10.620 --> 09:14.940
So x equals to y equals two squared.

09:15.100 --> 09:19.500
And now I want to know does x times two equal y.

09:19.940 --> 09:24.540
So this is a confusing line of code when you first look at it.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.420
Because you know there's three equal signs floating around here.

09:28.780 --> 09:31.380
So let's ignore this visually.

09:31.380 --> 09:33.340
Just get it out of your mind for the moment.

09:33.380 --> 09:37.260
This is just saying you know we are assigning some value to some variable.

09:37.660 --> 09:44.940
Here is the key question or the key operation that we are implementing here x squared x times two which

09:44.940 --> 09:45.540
is four.

09:45.780 --> 09:49.020
And then does that equal y which was defined as two squared.

09:49.300 --> 09:52.540
So there the answer is yes or true.

09:52.780 --> 09:57.940
And that value of true gets assigned to this variable outcome.

09:58.260 --> 09:58.540
Okay.

09:58.580 --> 10:03.700
So that is how you create variables in a boolean type.

10:03.700 --> 10:04.460
Variables.
