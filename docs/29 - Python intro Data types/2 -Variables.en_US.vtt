00:01.640 --> 00:09.040
If we only ever needed to work with a small number of numbers like this, then this would be great.

00:09.080 --> 00:14.280
What you learned in the last video would be everything you'd need to code in Python.

00:14.680 --> 00:23.160
But we will be working with large collections of numbers organized into vectors and matrices and tensors.

00:23.320 --> 00:27.440
Not to mention other kinds of information like strings and so on.

00:27.720 --> 00:34.720
And so we quickly run out of patience trying to write out hundreds or billions of numbers like this.

00:34.720 --> 00:41.920
So instead we are going to start organizing and storing information into variables.

00:42.200 --> 00:42.400
Okay.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.120
And that's the main point of this video.

00:45.320 --> 00:50.560
There are many different types of variables for different types of information that we want to store.

00:51.040 --> 00:56.840
In this video, I will introduce you to a very small number of types of variables, and you will learn

00:56.840 --> 01:03.040
about other types of variables as you progress throughout this Python intro and also in the rest of

01:03.040 --> 01:03.840
the course.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.680
So let's begin with setting a variable to be a number.

01:08.680 --> 01:11.240
So I will write x equals five.

01:11.800 --> 01:18.600
So now I'm creating a variable x and I'm defining it as being equal to the number five.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.400
Now when I run this cell it doesn't produce any output.

01:23.440 --> 01:23.720
Okay.

01:23.760 --> 01:29.240
So that's a little bit different from like these cells where we ran the code cell and we got an output

01:29.640 --> 01:29.880
here.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.560
We don't get an output because there's an assignment.

01:32.560 --> 01:40.080
So when you have an assignment of information into a variable then Python does not actually produce

01:40.080 --> 01:41.120
any output.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.280
It runs the code but it doesn't display anything.

01:44.600 --> 01:50.160
But we can display the information that we have stored in here just by writing out the variable.

01:50.400 --> 01:55.920
So now we see that x equals five which is exactly what we set it to okay.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.040
And then I will define another variable.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.720
How about 4.5.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.070
So now I have two variables.

02:02.070 --> 02:04.470
And yeah, we don't get any output here.

02:04.710 --> 02:10.270
And now what we can do is start working with these variables the way that we have previously worked

02:10.270 --> 02:12.630
with just writing out the numbers.

02:12.790 --> 02:15.190
So I can write x plus y.

02:15.750 --> 02:19.190
And that is going to give me what do you think is going to be the output there.

02:19.870 --> 02:22.990
Well it's going to be five plus 4.5.

02:22.990 --> 02:25.550
So the answer is going to be 9.5.

02:25.590 --> 02:27.470
I'm sure you guessed that answer correctly.

02:28.590 --> 02:30.070
And we can keep working with this.

02:30.070 --> 02:35.150
We can say you know x plus y squared is 2525.

02:35.830 --> 02:43.070
Variables are really powerful because they allow us to keep reusing the same information repeatedly

02:43.070 --> 02:44.430
throughout the code.

02:44.790 --> 02:48.750
Now, you know, maybe in this case you think that this isn't really necessary.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.550
We don't need this variable here.

02:50.550 --> 02:56.390
But you will see when we start working with very large collections of numbers, that these variables

02:56.390 --> 02:58.030
really become critical.

02:58.510 --> 02:58.830
Okay.

02:58.870 --> 03:04.230
So far I've created two variables, and I gave each of them a single letter name.

03:04.230 --> 03:09.070
So just the variable x and just the letter y for this variable.

03:09.510 --> 03:16.110
Single letter variable names is fine in some cases if you're only using the variable for a short period

03:16.110 --> 03:23.310
of time, but very often it's helpful to write out longer variable names that are more meaningful that

03:23.310 --> 03:29.670
convey some information about what is the object that you are actually storing in that variable.

03:29.990 --> 03:34.390
So there are some rules and some guidelines for naming variables.

03:34.390 --> 03:42.110
So for example I can write down a longer variable name like this.

03:42.110 --> 03:47.230
So now I have lots and lots of letters inside this variable name.

03:47.230 --> 03:49.670
And I don't know let's set that equal to 17.

03:49.710 --> 03:53.470
How about 17 to the power of 4.3.

03:53.510 --> 03:54.030
There you go.

03:54.030 --> 03:56.430
Just to make things a little more interesting okay.

03:56.470 --> 04:01.750
Now you know, on the one hand this variable I was just curious what this number actually equals.

04:02.350 --> 04:06.910
This variable is longer, so it's more work to write out.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.150
It takes up more room.

04:08.510 --> 04:16.310
And but on the other hand, it is also going to allow us a way to convey information about what is actually

04:16.310 --> 04:16.950
contained.

04:16.990 --> 04:23.670
Now in this case this is not very informative, but you will see that we get longer names that are actually

04:23.670 --> 04:24.430
informative.

04:25.550 --> 04:28.910
And notice also so a couple things I want to point out.

04:28.910 --> 04:34.750
So I could write a longer variable variable name like this.

04:34.750 --> 04:38.670
Let's set this b I don't know 14 times three.

04:38.710 --> 04:39.230
Whatever.

04:40.190 --> 04:46.870
These two variable names may look the same to you, but they are not the same to Python.

04:46.870 --> 04:53.790
So Python is case sensitive, which means that these two names, although they contain the same letters

04:53.790 --> 05:00.740
because there are lowercase letters here and uppercase letters here, these actually are completely

05:00.740 --> 05:02.300
different variables.

05:02.460 --> 05:09.420
And yeah, just to demonstrate that I'm going to print let's see I'll print out this one and then I

05:09.420 --> 05:09.820
will.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.500
So I'm just copying and pasting here.

05:11.540 --> 05:13.060
And then I will print out this one.

05:13.060 --> 05:17.140
And here you see that these are two distinct variables.

05:17.620 --> 05:18.060
Okay.

05:18.620 --> 05:25.820
Uh another thing that I want to point out is that here I have all of the new words with capital letters

05:25.820 --> 05:29.700
like this that helps you read the variable name.

05:29.740 --> 05:32.220
This is called camel case.

05:32.220 --> 05:39.420
That's the specific term in computer science for when variables have multiple words, or variable names

05:39.420 --> 05:40.900
have multiple words.

05:41.380 --> 05:44.700
And each word begins with an uppercase letter.

05:44.740 --> 05:46.220
So it's like a camel with humps.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.940
I think that's the way you're supposed to see it.

05:49.020 --> 05:53.940
The other style is called another naming style.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.220
Style equals.

05:56.220 --> 05:57.380
I'll just set this to be for.

05:57.420 --> 06:00.420
This one is called Snake case.

06:00.420 --> 06:07.260
So here the idea is that you still have multiple words in a variable name, but those words are separated

06:07.260 --> 06:13.260
by, uh, by an underscore instead of by capitalizing each new word.

06:13.660 --> 06:15.780
So camel case and snake case.

06:16.020 --> 06:20.700
If you look around on the internet, you will find people who have very strong opinions about which

06:20.740 --> 06:22.980
of these styles should and should not be used.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.060
I have no personal preference.

06:25.060 --> 06:26.580
I have no skin in this game.

06:27.020 --> 06:33.940
I think the important thing is to have variable names that are sensible, that provide some information

06:33.940 --> 06:40.740
about, uh, or some hints about the information that they provide and also that is readable to other

06:40.740 --> 06:41.340
people.

06:41.540 --> 06:47.900
Um, so you will actually see in my code throughout this course I use both camel case and snake case.

06:48.140 --> 06:51.460
Uh, sometimes I just pick one style at random.

06:51.460 --> 06:59.020
Sometimes I think certain names look better, look more readable in camel case versus snake case, there's

06:59.020 --> 07:00.660
was really as you like.

07:01.660 --> 07:08.500
That said, there are some commonalities between these two variable names, and in particular they do

07:08.500 --> 07:10.420
not contain any spaces.

07:10.580 --> 07:13.900
So this for example is not a variable.

07:14.180 --> 07:14.620
Okay.

07:14.660 --> 07:17.700
So the problem here is that we have spaces.

07:17.900 --> 07:26.260
Whereas you know this is a valid variable name because this has no spaces and this does have spaces.

07:26.500 --> 07:31.140
Now you can see that here I have a non-alphanumeric character.

07:31.340 --> 07:32.620
So an underscore.

07:32.780 --> 07:39.380
So that might lead you to wonder whether it's possible to use other non-alphanumeric characters like,

07:39.420 --> 07:40.580
I don't know, a question mark.

07:40.620 --> 07:41.580
So how about this.

07:41.820 --> 07:47.020
Also not a variable.

07:47.180 --> 07:47.500
Okay.

07:47.540 --> 07:49.700
So this is also going to give us an error.

07:50.100 --> 07:57.700
And here the problem is that Python does not allow us to use other non-alphanumeric characters as variable

07:57.700 --> 08:00.650
names, except for the underscore.

08:00.690 --> 08:01.850
That's an exception.

08:02.370 --> 08:05.370
So underscores can be used in variable names.

08:05.370 --> 08:10.290
But most other special characters cannot be used in variable names.

08:10.650 --> 08:13.770
But there are some other opportunities that we have.

08:13.770 --> 08:16.130
So we can have numbers.

08:16.130 --> 08:18.650
We can have a number to use.

08:18.690 --> 08:22.090
So you can use the number two in place of two.

08:23.010 --> 08:25.090
So this is completely fine.

08:25.090 --> 08:26.330
That is allowed.

08:27.330 --> 08:30.250
And this sort of notation we use often.

08:30.250 --> 08:35.530
Let me say you know a parameter for the analysis something like this.

08:35.530 --> 08:42.290
So this you will also see as well substituting the number four instead of the word four to indicate

08:42.330 --> 08:46.610
a variable that will be used for a specific application.

08:47.210 --> 08:51.170
All that said numbers can be inside of variable names.

08:51.170 --> 08:57.290
They can be at the end of variable names like this, but they cannot be at the beginning of a variable

08:57.290 --> 08:57.770
name.

08:57.930 --> 09:04.250
So this is not allowed because we can have numbers in the variable names, but not at the beginning

09:04.250 --> 09:06.010
of the variable name.

09:06.370 --> 09:06.930
Very good.

09:06.970 --> 09:12.410
So that is some information about variable naming conventions and rules.

09:12.570 --> 09:20.410
And now so far we've only been working with variables that are numeric so that contain information about

09:20.450 --> 09:21.290
numbers.

09:21.410 --> 09:26.610
There's another type of variable that encodes strings or characters.

09:26.770 --> 09:32.330
So here we can have a string variable and that equals the word hello.

09:32.650 --> 09:36.450
And notice that this is going to give us an error.

09:36.770 --> 09:41.850
In fact the issue here is that Python is actually thinking that hello.

09:42.090 --> 09:47.530
Here is a variable that we have previously defined, but we have not actually defined a variable called

09:47.530 --> 09:48.090
hello.

09:48.370 --> 09:49.930
So that's why we get an error.

09:50.130 --> 09:54.570
Instead what I want to do is have this be a string for.

09:54.570 --> 09:55.130
Hello.

09:55.450 --> 09:57.170
So you see the single quotes here.

09:57.170 --> 10:00.890
So now we can see what this variable outputs.

10:00.890 --> 10:02.890
And it is the the word hello.

10:02.930 --> 10:04.810
Or actually you know these five characters.

10:04.810 --> 10:05.250
Hello.

10:05.770 --> 10:06.210
Okay.

10:06.250 --> 10:11.450
And now we can start doing math with strings which sounds kind of funny but it is possible.

10:11.450 --> 10:13.450
So string variable.

10:13.570 --> 10:17.290
Now what's going to happen if we multiply this string by two.

10:17.730 --> 10:24.530
If you think about, you know, common sense, it might seem weird to, you know, we know what multiplication

10:24.530 --> 10:28.530
of numbers means, but what does it mean to multiply hello by two.

10:28.810 --> 10:30.970
Well, let's just try it and find out.

10:31.490 --> 10:32.730
So we get hello.

10:32.730 --> 10:33.210
Hello.

10:33.210 --> 10:41.850
So when you use the asterisk symbol on a string variable, it repeats that variable some number of times.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.530
So here I can write hello hello hello hello hello.

10:44.570 --> 10:45.530
Four times like this.

10:45.530 --> 10:51.210
Now I'm going to redefine this to be uh, to include a space in here.

10:51.370 --> 10:55.930
So notice that this is not a space outside of the quote here.

10:55.930 --> 11:03.320
These spaces are completely ignored by Python, but this space over here is inside the quote.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.920
So this is actually part of the string.

11:06.240 --> 11:11.440
And that you see here, you see there's some space between the O and the single quote here.

11:11.560 --> 11:11.800
Okay.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.200
So now when we multiply this by four we're going to get spaces.

11:15.200 --> 11:19.120
So we see a very enthusiastic greeting over here.

11:19.520 --> 11:19.840
Okay.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.400
So that is multiplying by an integer or a whole number.

11:23.560 --> 11:27.840
What do you think would happen if we multiply by let's say 2.5.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.320
Maybe it's going to repeat this twice.

11:31.320 --> 11:36.200
And then one time we only get half like the, you know, hell or h-e-l.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.480
Let's see what happens, huh?

11:38.520 --> 11:39.880
So we get an error.

11:40.160 --> 11:44.600
And this says that we cannot multiply the sequence, which is this string.

11:44.600 --> 11:51.200
It's a sequence of letters by a non integer of type float okay.

11:51.240 --> 11:58.920
So this is a little bit confusing to interpret if you're new to like coding and computer science.

11:58.920 --> 12:04.880
But effectively what Python is saying is I know how to repeat a sequence twice.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.280
I don't know what it means to repeat a sequence 2.5 times.

12:09.680 --> 12:09.920
Okay.

12:09.960 --> 12:14.720
And this is a nice transition into different types of variables.

12:14.880 --> 12:20.760
So I've already said that we have variables for numbers here I've created a variable for a string.

12:21.840 --> 12:29.000
We can actually figure out the type of information that is contained in a variable by using the function

12:29.040 --> 12:30.160
type like this.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.240
So you already know about this function print.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.120
And now here is another function called type.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.240
So let's do type x.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.520
And we can see that type x is int.

12:41.680 --> 12:46.120
This stands for integer which is the same thing as a whole number okay.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.080
So the number you know the counting numbers are integers.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.520
And then we have let's see string variable.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.920
And this is of type str which stands for string.

12:57.310 --> 13:01.230
And then we have let's see, what else do we have a longer variable name.

13:03.070 --> 13:05.310
And here we get a float okay.

13:05.350 --> 13:12.430
So now you have seen three different types of variables an int a string and a float.

13:12.790 --> 13:17.270
INTs are integers, strings are characters alphanumeric characters.

13:17.590 --> 13:19.110
And what is a float?

13:19.110 --> 13:25.950
Well, a float stands for or short for floating point number, which means that there is a decimal point

13:25.950 --> 13:26.590
in there.

13:26.870 --> 13:34.830
So this is an important distinction to appreciate in code in computers that there is a difference between

13:34.830 --> 13:39.830
the integer ten and the floating point number 10.0.

13:40.830 --> 13:47.030
Now when you look at these two numbers, let me actually I'll very briefly introduce you to another

13:47.030 --> 13:47.950
concept here.

13:48.070 --> 13:54.550
I'm going to take the output of this function and embed it into another function okay.

13:54.590 --> 13:59.950
So I have this function for type And then I embed it into the function print.

14:00.390 --> 14:00.710
Okay.

14:00.750 --> 14:04.750
So then we have this number which is a float.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.030
And this is an int.

14:06.070 --> 14:12.190
Now when you as a human look at these two numbers you probably think well these are you know exactly

14:12.190 --> 14:12.910
the same number.

14:12.910 --> 14:14.270
It's both the number ten.

14:14.630 --> 14:17.070
But for computer these actually are different.

14:17.470 --> 14:21.350
They are different in terms of possibilities for uses.

14:21.350 --> 14:28.470
For example, we can think about repeating a string ten times, but we cannot really think about repeating

14:28.470 --> 14:35.510
a string 10.0 times because this is, you know, similar data type to 10.2 times.

14:35.990 --> 14:42.550
And also in terms of just memory storage, it takes more memory on the computer to store this number

14:42.550 --> 14:44.950
compared to this number okay.

14:44.990 --> 14:47.070
So these actually are distinct.

14:47.630 --> 14:54.110
In some cases you will find that it doesn't matter for a particular operation that you're trying to

14:54.110 --> 14:54.830
perform.

14:54.830 --> 15:02.430
It may not matter whether you use a float or an int, but there are other situations where it really

15:02.430 --> 15:04.630
does matter and your code will crash.

15:04.950 --> 15:08.950
If you think you're using an int but you're actually using a float.

15:09.390 --> 15:11.710
You will see examples of this later on.

15:12.150 --> 15:17.430
Okay, so different types of variables for strings, for ints and for floating point numbers.

15:18.110 --> 15:25.910
I guess one thing I wanted to discuss up here with the strings is also let me see num as string, just

15:25.910 --> 15:32.230
to highlight the difference between this num as float 2.4.

15:33.030 --> 15:37.510
Now these two variables here are not the same thing.

15:37.510 --> 15:39.790
You can see they're also colored differently.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.790
This is actually a number we can work with this number.

15:42.790 --> 15:45.630
We can do arithmetic with this number.

15:45.830 --> 15:47.390
This is a string.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.990
It is written out 2.4.

15:50.030 --> 15:51.510
It's the string 2.4.

15:51.510 --> 15:53.550
We cannot work with this number.

15:53.590 --> 15:58.020
And to demonstrate that we can try doing arithmetic with this variable.

15:58.260 --> 16:03.660
So two times four times 2 or 2.4 times two.

16:03.700 --> 16:08.220
Well you know, if we're thinking about this as a number then we know the answer to this.

16:08.260 --> 16:09.860
It's 4.8 right.

16:09.900 --> 16:14.260
But if you run this equation you get 2.42.4.

16:14.540 --> 16:21.820
On the other hand, if I do num as float times two, then here we get 4.8 as expected.

16:22.260 --> 16:22.700
Okay.

16:22.980 --> 16:27.540
There are ways to convert back and forth between these, but I'm not going to worry about.

16:27.580 --> 16:31.420
Well, actually, now that I've mentioned it, I will tell you this just very quickly.

16:31.420 --> 16:31.740
Okay.

16:31.780 --> 16:37.580
So num as string and I can use another function called float.

16:38.020 --> 16:43.460
Um, so this is converting this string into a floating point number.

16:43.580 --> 16:48.540
And now we actually can use this as a regular number.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.220
The way you think about numbers and multiplying it by two.

16:52.180 --> 16:57.300
So far I have been using single quotes to indicate strings.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.140
And why do I do that?

16:59.180 --> 17:03.740
Why not double quotes and do the double quotes mean something completely different?

17:04.060 --> 17:10.940
Well, it turns out that single quotes and double quotes can be used in the same way, but we need to

17:10.940 --> 17:16.900
have both, because we need to allow for a situation where we have apostrophes.

17:17.060 --> 17:21.940
So if I want to refer to my books, then you can already see the lettering.

17:22.260 --> 17:25.060
The coloring of these letters is different here.

17:25.260 --> 17:33.180
So what's actually happening here is Python sees this as a string, and it doesn't know what to do with

17:33.180 --> 17:33.900
all of this.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.180
And it thinks that something is missing here.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.460
So it says Unterminated string literal.

17:39.100 --> 17:44.940
I apologize on behalf of the Python developers for these syntax error messages.

17:44.940 --> 17:49.460
They are not so easy to decipher.

17:49.660 --> 17:55.380
But as you start working more with Python, you will get a hang of how to interpret these errors.

17:55.940 --> 17:56.140
Okay.

17:56.180 --> 18:02.580
But anyway, the point is that, uh, Python just doesn't really know how to make sense of this.

18:02.580 --> 18:07.940
So instead, we can encase this entire expression in double quotes.

18:07.940 --> 18:13.180
And now you see that all of these letters have the same, uh, color.

18:13.540 --> 18:13.820
Okay.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.820
And now, yeah, that's, uh, we have an apostrophe in there.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.980
And the opposite is also possible.

18:18.980 --> 18:24.460
So I can encase the outer string so the full string in single quotes.

18:24.460 --> 18:27.580
And I can have a double quote inside here.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.540
So for the possessive case this looks awkward.

18:30.540 --> 18:33.500
But you can imagine saying something like this.

18:33.660 --> 18:34.980
Mike says hi.

18:35.020 --> 18:35.540
There you go.

18:35.540 --> 18:37.340
So this is now possible.

18:37.780 --> 18:41.620
So basically you can use single quotes or double quotes as you like.

18:42.260 --> 18:42.660
Okay.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.340
Now I'm going to create some new variables.

18:45.340 --> 18:47.020
First name.

18:47.140 --> 18:48.180
Let me do it like this.

18:48.180 --> 18:52.700
First name equals Mike and last name equals Cohen.

18:52.700 --> 18:53.340
That's me.

18:53.740 --> 18:58.210
Uh, so uh, here you see what I'm referring to with meaningful variable names.

18:58.210 --> 19:04.810
If I call this A and B, you know, when you look here where I'm defining these, these variables,

19:04.810 --> 19:06.210
then you say, okay, it's easy.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.450
A is the first name, B is the second name.

19:09.130 --> 19:15.650
But maybe I'm going to keep using these variables many different times throughout a code file that has

19:15.690 --> 19:17.250
hundreds of lines of code.

19:17.490 --> 19:23.930
So then it's much easier to understand this code if you define it, if you give these variable names,

19:23.930 --> 19:27.410
meaningful interpretable names.

19:27.850 --> 19:32.810
Okay, so you already know that I can do something like this and multiply.

19:33.010 --> 19:35.970
What would it mean to add two strings together.

19:36.090 --> 19:36.930
Let's try that.

19:36.930 --> 19:39.890
So first name plus last name.

19:40.170 --> 19:42.530
You can probably guess what's going to happen.

19:42.530 --> 19:45.210
It's just going to put them next to each other.

19:45.210 --> 19:47.370
And this is called concatenation.

19:47.530 --> 19:53.290
So we are concatenating these two strings using this plus sign.

19:53.770 --> 20:01.250
In general this uh, concept of, uh, using the same operations in different ways depending on the

20:01.250 --> 20:04.490
variable type is called overloading.

20:04.690 --> 20:12.410
This is a term in computer science for when the plus sign means addition with numbers, and it means

20:12.410 --> 20:14.450
concatenation with strings.

20:14.690 --> 20:15.090
Okay.

20:15.250 --> 20:16.130
Overloading.

20:16.330 --> 20:18.770
Now I don't you know, I want to have a space in here.

20:18.770 --> 20:25.050
So I'm actually going to, uh, add or concatenate a space in here like this.

20:25.210 --> 20:28.210
And now we get Mike Cohen with a space in the middle.

20:28.210 --> 20:31.010
And that comes from this part over here.

20:31.770 --> 20:32.210
Okay.

20:32.250 --> 20:33.290
And then let's see.

20:33.290 --> 20:37.210
There's one last thing I want to introduce you to in this video.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.290
And let's say age is how old do you think I am?

20:40.450 --> 20:42.090
I'm going to say 26.

20:42.770 --> 20:44.930
Uh, let's say uh, space.

20:44.930 --> 20:45.730
Let's see what we have here.

20:45.730 --> 20:54.450
Mike Cohen is and then I'm going to add another space is and then I want age and then plus years old.

20:55.050 --> 20:57.970
So what I want this to say is a message.

20:57.970 --> 21:06.010
I want this to print out a message that says Mike Cohen is I need and is here like this is.

21:06.410 --> 21:07.930
And then another plus sign here.

21:07.930 --> 21:13.730
You can see it gets pretty complicated to keep track of is 26 years old okay.

21:13.770 --> 21:15.010
So this seems fine.

21:15.010 --> 21:15.410
It is.

21:15.450 --> 21:20.090
You know, you've already seen me struggling a little bit with getting all these plus signs in here.

21:20.130 --> 21:22.050
Let's see what happens, huh?

21:22.170 --> 21:29.130
We get an error and the error says can only concatenate string to string and not int.

21:29.410 --> 21:29.730
Okay.

21:29.770 --> 21:33.410
So the problem here is that age is an integer.

21:33.730 --> 21:37.330
And all of these are strings.

21:37.570 --> 21:43.450
So the plus sign is addition for numbers but concatenation for strings.

21:43.610 --> 21:47.810
And we're trying to mix those different overloaded operations.

21:47.930 --> 21:50.330
And Python is just getting confused.

21:50.650 --> 21:59.480
So what we need to do here is transform this variable from a number into a string, and that is easy

21:59.480 --> 22:04.320
to do using the function str, which converts a number into a string.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.400
And now we get a result.

22:07.160 --> 22:15.960
Now it turns out that this is by far not the best way to print out multiple variables like this together

22:15.960 --> 22:17.840
in one line of text.

22:18.480 --> 22:25.160
In a later section, I will introduce you to better methods like interpolation and f strings.

22:25.200 --> 22:31.000
F strings in particular are fantastic for this kind of text formatting, but that will come later.

22:31.040 --> 22:36.160
For now, suffice it to say that the plus sign can be used for string concatenation.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.360
So this was quite an action packed video.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.280
You learned all about variables.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.720
You learned about different types of variables.

22:44.840 --> 22:51.560
You learned about naming conventions and naming rules, and you learned about combining information

22:51.560 --> 22:54.960
by string concatenation to print out a message.
