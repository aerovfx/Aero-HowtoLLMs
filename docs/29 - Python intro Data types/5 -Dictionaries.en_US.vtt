00:01.560 --> 00:06.400
Now I will introduce you to a variable type called a dictionary.

00:06.760 --> 00:13.720
Dictionary A dictionary is a little bit more complicated than the other types of variables that I've

00:13.760 --> 00:15.440
introduced you to so far.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.080
But dictionaries are powerful.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.360
They're used a lot.

00:19.480 --> 00:26.120
They are a very convenient way to organize a lot of information in one variable.

00:26.280 --> 00:32.680
You can think of a dictionary as kind of like a lookup table, where you have some key or some critical

00:32.680 --> 00:39.120
piece of information, and that is going to unlock some other piece of information that is stored in

00:39.120 --> 00:40.480
the same variable type.

00:40.760 --> 00:46.320
Okay, I realize that probably sounds very vague and weird, so let's just start coding and you will

00:46.320 --> 00:47.840
see how dictionaries work.

00:48.280 --> 00:55.320
Okay, so I'm going to initialize a dictionary using this special keyword dict for dictionary.

00:55.320 --> 00:59.510
You can see that as I typed this it went from black to being this kind of.

00:59.550 --> 01:00.150
Green.

01:00.230 --> 01:00.870
Greenish.

01:00.910 --> 01:01.750
Bluish color.

01:02.070 --> 01:02.430
Okay.

01:02.470 --> 01:06.630
So now we can see D has curly brackets here.

01:06.630 --> 01:10.230
So curly brackets are associated with dictionaries.

01:10.390 --> 01:15.070
You have already seen that lists are associated with square brackets.

01:15.350 --> 01:19.150
So when you see square brackets you can think about lists.

01:19.150 --> 01:22.750
And when you see curly brackets you can think about dictionaries.

01:23.030 --> 01:23.190
Okay.

01:23.230 --> 01:26.790
Let me zoom back out here to something a little more readable.

01:27.110 --> 01:27.510
Okay.

01:27.550 --> 01:30.510
So this is just a empty dictionary.

01:30.670 --> 01:33.190
It does not contain any information.

01:33.190 --> 01:37.030
All I've done is initialize this empty dictionary.

01:37.390 --> 01:37.750
Okay.

01:37.790 --> 01:43.150
So now I am going to create a key value pair.

01:43.430 --> 01:43.790
Okay.

01:43.830 --> 01:46.990
So here I'm creating this is called a key.

01:47.030 --> 01:48.390
And I'm calling it name.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.910
And this is the value.

01:51.150 --> 01:52.350
And I'm calling it Mike.

01:52.350 --> 01:56.550
So now if we look at our dictionary again we see again curly brackets.

01:56.550 --> 02:01.450
And now I have name and then a colon and then Mike.

02:01.850 --> 02:02.210
Okay.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.770
So now what can we do with this.

02:03.770 --> 02:08.930
So now I can access this piece of information using name.

02:09.890 --> 02:11.370
Now don't get confused here.

02:11.370 --> 02:11.690
So.

02:11.850 --> 02:15.450
So I inputted name in the square brackets and it outputted Mike.

02:15.450 --> 02:18.290
So this is the key and this is the value.

02:18.570 --> 02:25.170
Now try not to get confused about what I just said about lists with what you see here with accessing

02:25.410 --> 02:27.690
some information from this dictionary.

02:28.010 --> 02:35.330
When you have a list, you can access particular elements in that list using indexing like this.

02:35.690 --> 02:41.690
However, this is not the way that you access information from a dictionary.

02:41.930 --> 02:48.930
Okay, so it is a little bit confusing the difference between lists and dictionaries in terms of accessing

02:48.930 --> 02:50.330
information from them.

02:50.330 --> 02:59.040
But with a list you access using indexing and with a dictionary you have to know that the name of the

02:59.600 --> 03:07.880
key and that will provide the, uh, that will return the name of the information associated with that

03:07.920 --> 03:08.280
key.

03:08.680 --> 03:08.960
Okay.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.680
So now I'm going to create another key value pair.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.560
And let's say age range equals uh 20 to 50.

03:16.600 --> 03:20.240
Because I suppose my age is probably somewhere in that range.

03:20.680 --> 03:20.920
Okay.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.760
Now this is a string.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.720
And this here is a list which comprises integers.

03:26.880 --> 03:33.320
So you can see that in this dictionary we are mixing up lots of different types of variables.

03:33.840 --> 03:34.160
Okay.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.040
So now I have let's go back and look at this dictionary.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.280
So now you can see this dictionary I'll zoom in a little bit.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.160
Uh curly brackets to indicate the dictionary.

03:44.160 --> 03:49.960
And then we have one key value pair and then separated by a comma.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.280
And then another key value pair okay.

03:53.320 --> 03:59.060
And you've already seen that to access one key value pair, you type name.

03:59.660 --> 04:02.540
And then the other one was age range.

04:02.540 --> 04:10.100
And that retrieves this information here, which is the list of integers that I associated with this

04:10.100 --> 04:12.540
key age range okay.

04:12.580 --> 04:16.140
So this is one way to create a dictionary.

04:16.180 --> 04:20.780
And here we create it one key value pair at a time.

04:21.340 --> 04:24.340
And first initializing it to an empty dictionary.

04:24.460 --> 04:30.780
It's actually possible to initialize or to create a dictionary with just all this information in here

04:31.100 --> 04:31.860
right off the bat.

04:31.860 --> 04:33.980
So let's create another dictionary I'll call this.

04:33.980 --> 04:34.820
How about Q.

04:35.180 --> 04:41.180
And now I'm going to initialize this by starting with a curly bracket.

04:41.340 --> 04:45.660
And then I'm going to type the key and then the value pair.

04:45.940 --> 04:46.940
And then a comma.

04:47.140 --> 04:50.340
And here's going to be the next one age range.

04:50.700 --> 04:58.490
Uh and then the information there, 20 to say 60, just to give a nice broader range there.

04:58.850 --> 04:59.210
Okay.

04:59.250 --> 05:02.450
Notice again, maybe I'll even put this on a separate line.

05:03.490 --> 05:03.850
Okay.

05:03.890 --> 05:13.130
So again, I am creating this dictionary or this variable in general using multiple lines of the code

05:13.130 --> 05:13.730
space.

05:13.850 --> 05:22.050
And that is going to allow us to basically put in comments here that will provide some more explanations

05:22.450 --> 05:27.090
about what these different key value pairs actually mean.

05:27.130 --> 05:27.330
Okay.

05:27.370 --> 05:32.530
And then this is just to show you we get the same thing that I created up here with D.

05:32.730 --> 05:35.530
So just different ways to create a dictionary.

05:35.930 --> 05:36.250
Okay.

05:36.290 --> 05:42.170
So how do you know all of the keys and values that are inside a dictionary.

05:42.410 --> 05:47.530
Well you know if it's very small like this you can just look at the code and how it's defined.

05:47.850 --> 05:54.990
But later on in the course you will see many situations where we will import dictionaries from other

05:54.990 --> 06:01.990
libraries from other variables, and we need to know what are all the keys that are created by that

06:01.990 --> 06:03.630
are stored in this dictionary.

06:03.990 --> 06:04.270
Okay.

06:04.310 --> 06:09.310
So for this we can type D dot keys like this.

06:10.430 --> 06:15.790
So notice this very special formulation this syntax I have the name of the variable.

06:16.070 --> 06:20.270
And then a period and then this reserved word keys.

06:20.310 --> 06:23.710
And then open close parentheses with nothing inside it.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.390
So we don't have anything inside.

06:25.670 --> 06:30.430
So the name of the dictionary and then dot and then keys.

06:31.030 --> 06:38.590
Later on in this tutorial in a couple of sections later, I'm going to start calling this a method that

06:38.590 --> 06:42.350
is applied to an object or an instance of a class.

06:42.670 --> 06:47.510
So all of this stuff is related to object oriented programming and classes.

06:47.510 --> 06:50.940
Is and, you know, high level coding concepts like that.

06:50.940 --> 06:54.060
You don't need to worry about those terms yet.

06:54.420 --> 06:57.660
For now, you just need to focus on this concept.

06:57.660 --> 07:06.020
So we have a variable name that we've created and then a dot and then some method or some piece of information

07:06.020 --> 07:07.420
that we want to extract.

07:07.540 --> 07:07.820
Okay.

07:07.860 --> 07:14.180
So this gives us all of the keys that we that are stored inside this variable.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.740
And there's lots of things you can do with this.

07:16.740 --> 07:20.780
You can create for loops to access information from all the keys.

07:20.980 --> 07:25.180
You can associate the different items with the keys and the values from the keys.

07:25.540 --> 07:34.380
We can also extract all of the values by using a similar type of syntax, a similar formulation.

07:34.380 --> 07:38.860
So I have d and then here just for some variety I'll use q here instead.

07:39.220 --> 07:39.500
Okay.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.300
So here we got the keys.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.580
And here I'm getting the values.

07:43.900 --> 07:47.160
And then you can see this is Mike and 2060.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.880
This numerical list here.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.480
Okay, so we got the keys.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.280
We got the values.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.400
Of course, these are associated with each other, right?

07:54.440 --> 07:57.240
There is one key that goes with one value.

07:57.440 --> 08:02.880
So we can also access these as pairs using a method called items.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.200
So q items.

08:04.200 --> 08:08.520
And now you can see this is actually really similar to just the.

08:08.960 --> 08:13.320
Let me uh let's see just the dictionary itself.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.240
It's all the same information.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.360
It's still paired.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.840
So the keys and the values.

08:19.080 --> 08:26.520
But with dot items this actually creates a special type of Python variable called an iterable.

08:26.800 --> 08:33.080
And we can use these in a special way in for loops and while loops.

08:33.080 --> 08:42.320
So you will learn more about using dot items this syntax later in the Python tutorial, but I just wanted

08:42.320 --> 08:43.360
to introduce it here.
