00:01.640 --> 00:05.320
Let's begin with some basic math and comments.

00:05.480 --> 00:09.320
So here we are in a brand new notebook file.

00:09.800 --> 00:14.480
And what I'm going to do is write four asterisk five.

00:14.680 --> 00:19.880
So the asterisk actually has multiple meanings in Python depending on the context.

00:20.120 --> 00:28.400
But when the asterisk is surrounded by numbers or by variables that represent numbers, then the asterisk

00:28.400 --> 00:31.000
is interpreted as multiplication.

00:31.480 --> 00:31.800
Okay.

00:31.840 --> 00:36.560
So we know that four times five is 20 because I'm a math genius.

00:36.560 --> 00:37.720
So that's how I know that.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.560
And this gives us a nice confirmation here.

00:40.920 --> 00:41.280
Okay.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.800
And this works for numbers.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.840
It works for uh, you know with decimals as well.

00:45.960 --> 00:50.080
So four times 5.5 gives us an answer of 22.

00:50.240 --> 00:54.040
We can do, you know, some really ridiculously high precision number.

00:54.280 --> 01:02.200
I actually don't know what that answer is in my head, but Python tells me that it's 22.37, etc. and

01:02.240 --> 01:08.110
for this kind of stuff, I definitely trust Python more than I trust my own arithmetic brain.

01:08.590 --> 01:13.430
Okay, so you can already pause the video, take a moment and play around with this stuff.

01:13.710 --> 01:18.190
You can see, for example, what happens if we include spaces in here.

01:18.190 --> 01:23.550
So is this still a valid operation and is this any different from this?

01:23.950 --> 01:27.350
Well, you can pause the video and discover that for yourself.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.350
Uh, but now I will tell you the answer is no.

01:30.670 --> 01:32.950
It doesn't matter if we have spaces.

01:33.070 --> 01:36.150
Now, spaces in Python is a little bit tricky.

01:36.390 --> 01:43.590
There are situations in Python where spacing is really important, and it tells Python how to structure

01:43.590 --> 01:44.190
code.

01:44.710 --> 01:49.150
Uh, but there are other situations where spacing is irrelevant.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.390
So I can put in all these spaces in here.

01:52.390 --> 01:56.430
And Python is going to completely ignore all of these spaces.

01:56.710 --> 02:02.550
Again, there are other situations where spacing is really important, but you will get the hang of

02:02.550 --> 02:03.550
it as we go on.

02:03.950 --> 02:06.390
Okay, so this is multiplying two numbers.

02:06.510 --> 02:07.550
Here's a question.

02:07.630 --> 02:10.910
what's going to happen if I include another number in here?

02:11.190 --> 02:13.310
So four times five times four.

02:13.430 --> 02:14.750
Well no problem.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.630
We get an answer of 80.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.790
Very straightforward.

02:18.270 --> 02:18.590
Okay.

02:18.630 --> 02:23.150
What I'm going to introduce you to now is something called a comment.

02:23.670 --> 02:26.670
And before I start talking about comments notice the coloring here.

02:26.670 --> 02:30.030
So we have two colors in this line of code.

02:30.030 --> 02:34.710
Here we have this like dark green color for the numbers.

02:34.710 --> 02:37.510
And then the asterisk is in black.

02:37.710 --> 02:38.030
Okay.

02:38.070 --> 02:44.150
So now what I'm going to do is put a hash mark here and I will write a comment.

02:44.190 --> 02:45.990
Literally just writing a comment.

02:46.350 --> 02:51.630
So now I'm going to run this line of code and this code cell and nothing happens.

02:52.150 --> 02:52.830
It did run.

02:52.830 --> 02:54.110
We see a check mark here.

02:54.110 --> 02:58.270
It took zero seconds to run this code but it didn't do anything.

02:58.350 --> 03:02.590
Now, if I would get rid of that hash mark, you see the color change.

03:02.590 --> 03:04.630
So now these are black.

03:04.630 --> 03:06.670
This text is in black instead of green.

03:06.910 --> 03:09.470
And now when I run this code, we get an error.

03:09.710 --> 03:11.380
And the error is invalid.

03:11.380 --> 03:11.980
Syntax.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.220
So what does this mean?

03:14.260 --> 03:21.700
This means that Python gives us a special way to write information, to write text that is useful for

03:21.700 --> 03:28.260
us as humans for interpreting the code, but is completely ignored by Python.

03:28.620 --> 03:28.940
Okay.

03:28.980 --> 03:31.140
And that is the hash mark.

03:31.180 --> 03:35.300
Now, in these notebooks, there's a keyboard shortcut on the Mac.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.380
It is command.

03:36.540 --> 03:40.660
And then slash the slash and uh, and question mark key.

03:41.140 --> 03:47.380
And on Windows and Linux computers it's going to be command and then slash okay.

03:47.740 --> 03:50.780
So here just to show you we have four times five.

03:50.900 --> 03:53.780
So this is still a perfectly valid line of code.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.420
Uh but this is completely ignored.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.860
And now I can comment this line.

03:59.260 --> 04:02.820
And now we know we get no, uh, result here.

04:02.860 --> 04:04.700
And why do we get no result here?

04:04.700 --> 04:06.260
Because this is a comment.

04:06.260 --> 04:11.380
This is a piece of text that is completely ignored by Python.

04:11.900 --> 04:12.260
Okay.

04:12.300 --> 04:16.340
And you can have comments in lines completely on their own.

04:16.340 --> 04:17.020
Like this.

04:17.060 --> 04:20.180
You can also have comments after a valid line of code.

04:20.180 --> 04:22.700
So for example three times four.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.220
And now this actually is going to be evaluated.

04:26.220 --> 04:27.820
That gives us the number 12.

04:28.220 --> 04:29.620
This is ignored.

04:29.620 --> 04:31.700
It's a comment and this is ignored.

04:31.700 --> 04:32.620
It's a comment.

04:33.300 --> 04:33.820
Okay.

04:33.860 --> 04:36.780
So that's for multiplication.

04:36.780 --> 04:40.180
We can do division using this slash mark here.

04:40.420 --> 04:45.740
So three divided by four is three fourths or 0.75.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.820
And yeah you can do this as much as you like.

04:48.820 --> 04:50.500
You can play around with this a little bit.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.660
And now let's try addition.

04:53.660 --> 05:00.580
So three plus five again I know the answer should be eight because I'm a super duper math genius.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.620
And the answer is eight.

05:02.620 --> 05:03.500
But hey wait a minute.

05:03.500 --> 05:07.260
What happened to the result of three divided by 40?

05:07.740 --> 05:12.580
Did Python no longer run this line of code and it only ran this line of code?

05:13.180 --> 05:20.210
Actually, what happened here is that Python ran both of these lines of code, but it produces the output,

05:20.210 --> 05:25.770
or it displays the output only for the last line in a code cell.

05:26.170 --> 05:33.690
So you can have lots of lines of code within an individual code cell, but only the final one is going

05:33.690 --> 05:35.730
to display the output.

05:35.890 --> 05:40.290
But what if we want to know the results of this calculation?

05:41.370 --> 05:42.970
There are several ways we can do that.

05:42.970 --> 05:46.410
We can assign this to a variable and then print it out later.

05:46.410 --> 05:49.210
I will get back to that in a later video.

05:49.490 --> 05:55.210
For now, for the context of this video, I'm going to introduce you to your first Python function.

05:55.210 --> 05:57.410
And that is the function print.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.090
So here I write the word print.

06:00.090 --> 06:03.730
And I have an open parenthesis and then a closed parenthesis.

06:04.090 --> 06:10.850
And inside the parentheses is some, you know, results, some expression that I want to print.

06:10.850 --> 06:19.450
And that is going to tell Python to print out whatever is the result of this evaluation inside the parentheses

06:19.650 --> 06:20.770
in the output.

06:21.010 --> 06:24.970
So we get three divided by 40 from this line.

06:24.970 --> 06:29.770
And then the eight is from this line here three plus five okay.

06:30.130 --> 06:32.810
Here again we see some spaces in here.

06:33.210 --> 06:40.010
Uh I like putting spaces in this kind of a situation inputs into a function, because I find that it

06:40.010 --> 06:45.090
helps me visually understand what is taking place in this line of code.

06:46.130 --> 06:53.170
But this is another situation where the parentheses are, sorry, where the spaces are completely optional.

06:53.450 --> 06:57.610
So Python does not distinguish any of these spaces like this.

06:58.010 --> 06:58.890
They are all fine.

06:58.890 --> 07:01.250
They all give exactly identical results.

07:01.690 --> 07:09.130
To me this looks really ugly and awkward and more difficult to interpret, but for Python it's all exactly

07:09.130 --> 07:09.730
the same.

07:10.250 --> 07:17.090
Okay, so in my humble opinion this looks more readable, but you are free to disagree with me.

07:17.090 --> 07:22.810
You will get to develop your own coding style as you continue working with Python.

07:23.130 --> 07:25.640
Okay, so now we have the different operations.

07:25.680 --> 07:28.040
Of course this is how you do subtraction.

07:28.480 --> 07:35.920
And let's see I will show you one other arithmetic operation which is power or exponents.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.720
So here is three times two.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.240
Three times two is six.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.800
But what if we want three to the power of two.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.880
Uh, you might think of doing something like this.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.240
If you are familiar with LaTeX coding, this is how you would superscript something.

07:52.480 --> 07:57.800
Uh, if you are coming from other programming languages like Matlab, for example, this is how you

07:57.800 --> 08:01.000
would get three squared or three to the power of two.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.160
In Python you need to use double asterisks like this.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.520
So one asterisk is for multiplication.

08:09.640 --> 08:15.000
Two asterisks next to each other is for a power or exponentiation.

08:15.120 --> 08:19.840
So this gives us an answer of nine because uh yeah that is two squared.

08:20.040 --> 08:20.360
Okay.

08:20.400 --> 08:25.920
And then, uh, one final thing I did say this was the last thing I will show, but now I'm going to

08:25.920 --> 08:28.800
show you one more thing and that is parentheses.

08:29.040 --> 08:29.360
Okay.

08:29.400 --> 08:33.720
So if we want three cubed of course you can write three cubed out like this.

08:33.720 --> 08:37.600
But you can also add these numbers together.

08:37.600 --> 08:44.120
And you know maybe this is relevant inside a for loop if you are increasingly exponentiating three or

08:44.120 --> 08:45.120
something like that.

08:45.120 --> 08:50.920
So this is how you would get this is how you would group these numbers together, which is different

08:50.920 --> 08:55.000
from this formulation where we have ten now y is ten.

08:55.040 --> 09:01.280
The answer here, because there is something in arithmetic called the order of operations.

09:01.600 --> 09:07.040
And the order of operations, tells us to prioritize power over addition.

09:07.320 --> 09:14.880
So in fact, with this code here, like this, Python is interpreting three squared first.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.680
So that is nine.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.360
And then adding one.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.360
So that gives us ten okay.

09:20.400 --> 09:28.920
But what we actually want to do here is three to the power of two plus one which is 27.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.000
So three cubed.
