00:01.720 --> 00:08.320
In this video, I will introduce you to another type of variable called a list.

00:08.800 --> 00:16.320
A list is a way of organizing a collection of information like multiple numbers, multiple strings,

00:16.320 --> 00:19.400
or even a mix of different variable types.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.040
Okay, so let me start by creating a list.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.200
I'm going to call this variable name a list.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.240
And notice I'm using brackets here.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.040
So we have square brackets.

00:30.240 --> 00:36.360
When you see square brackets in the definition of a variable you know that we are going to be working

00:36.360 --> 00:37.440
with lists.

00:37.760 --> 00:38.080
Okay.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.080
So here I have looking at the output of a list.

00:41.080 --> 00:45.120
You can see it's literally just the things that I specified over here.

00:45.360 --> 00:52.680
Now what is important about a list is that the commas separate the different elements of the list.

00:52.840 --> 00:59.080
And we can access individual elements using an operation called indexing.

00:59.200 --> 01:05.600
So I am now going to index a specific number in this list.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.520
So let's say we want to access the number five.

01:08.720 --> 01:13.560
Maybe this is a parameter that we are using for one part of an analysis.

01:13.560 --> 01:20.080
And so we need to access not the entire list, not all the elements in the list, but only this second

01:20.080 --> 01:21.640
element in the list.

01:21.760 --> 01:22.080
Okay.

01:22.120 --> 01:26.120
So I'm going to write the number one in between the brackets here.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.680
And that's going to give me huh.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.200
That gave me a five.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.400
That's curious right.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.680
Because this is the first element in the list.

01:34.680 --> 01:37.040
This is the second element in the list.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.440
And yet the number one actually gave me this number five.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.520
So what's going on here?

01:41.960 --> 01:48.200
What's going on here is that Python is a zero based indexing language.

01:48.320 --> 01:48.520
Okay.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.880
I'll write that out because that's an important word zero based indexing.

01:53.160 --> 01:58.920
And that means that Python actually starts counting at zero, not at one.

01:59.360 --> 02:06.870
So the zeroth element or the first element, but it's an index position zero actually is four.

02:07.030 --> 02:08.390
And that's what we see here.

02:09.350 --> 02:13.830
So that means that this is index zero or position zero.

02:14.030 --> 02:17.350
This is index one, index two and index three.

02:17.830 --> 02:18.150
Okay.

02:18.190 --> 02:20.430
So now we can write index three.

02:20.590 --> 02:22.510
And that gives us the answer three.

02:22.870 --> 02:24.470
Now this is a little confusing.

02:24.470 --> 02:27.710
So do not be confused by this three.

02:27.990 --> 02:29.270
And this three.

02:29.590 --> 02:33.670
This three over here is a value in the list.

02:33.670 --> 02:35.870
It's an entry in the list.

02:35.870 --> 02:40.390
But it happens to have the index of position three.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.310
So this is an index.

02:42.310 --> 02:44.070
It corresponds to a position.

02:44.310 --> 02:46.030
This is a number.

02:46.030 --> 02:47.070
It's an element.

02:47.070 --> 02:49.470
And they just happen to map onto each other.

02:49.750 --> 02:53.070
And I can show you that here I'm going to say three whatever.

02:53.110 --> 02:56.550
This is just arbitrary I just want some information here.

02:56.950 --> 03:04.950
And then you can see that exactly this same code is still going to retrieve the item in position three,

03:05.790 --> 03:07.310
Starting from zero.

03:07.310 --> 03:09.590
So it's actually the fourth element.

03:10.030 --> 03:10.350
Okay.

03:10.390 --> 03:18.550
And then this, um, demonstration here also, uh, shows that, uh, a list can contain many different

03:18.590 --> 03:20.630
types of variables.

03:20.790 --> 03:22.790
So here I have integers.

03:22.790 --> 03:25.110
We can also create some floating point numbers.

03:25.110 --> 03:27.070
And here I have a string.

03:27.310 --> 03:30.670
And they can all be mixed into a list.

03:31.150 --> 03:36.310
So now what I'm going to do is recreate a list or define a new list.

03:36.630 --> 03:43.350
Uh, also incorporating some concepts that I told you about a few videos ago with regards to commenting

03:43.350 --> 03:44.630
and readability.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.030
Okay, so let's create a new list.

03:47.190 --> 03:53.150
And now I'm separating out the definition of this list onto multiple lines.

03:53.310 --> 03:55.470
So one and let's say hello.

03:55.510 --> 03:59.190
Of course you know these are just kind of arbitrary first second.

04:00.510 --> 04:03.830
And I need a comma there.

04:03.830 --> 04:09.580
And I'm going to call this parameter setting like this.

04:09.620 --> 04:14.460
Okay, so now notice that I'm still defining a list.

04:14.460 --> 04:16.740
It still contains four elements.

04:17.020 --> 04:24.140
And each element is separated by a comma and it's spread across multiple lines.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.220
And here I also want to show you.

04:27.660 --> 04:31.900
So now I'm going to copy this paste this I'll call this new list two.

04:32.420 --> 04:37.460
And now I'm just going to put these all on the same line.

04:40.260 --> 04:40.700
Okay.

04:40.740 --> 04:46.220
There are several important things going on inside several important Python concepts happening inside

04:46.220 --> 04:47.060
this code cell.

04:47.340 --> 04:52.140
One is that I've separated the definition of the list into multiple lines.

04:52.580 --> 04:58.980
A second important thing is that I've shown you that a list can actually contain another list.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.820
So here I'm creating a list.

05:00.820 --> 05:04.380
You can see it's a list because it has the square brackets.

05:04.740 --> 05:10.700
And this list is itself an element inside this list.

05:10.900 --> 05:11.220
Okay.

05:11.260 --> 05:20.740
And then finally, this is also demonstrating that Python doesn't care about the spaces and the returns,

05:20.740 --> 05:27.180
the new line characters separating these lines because these two lists are identical.

05:27.340 --> 05:35.380
So I will print out print new list one and I will print new list two.

05:35.740 --> 05:38.100
And now you can see that these are the same.

05:38.140 --> 05:40.100
Oh yeah I haven't defined this variable yet.

05:40.420 --> 05:41.220
Uh let's see.

05:41.700 --> 05:45.940
Parameter setting equals 48.3.

05:45.940 --> 05:46.500
Whatever.

05:47.380 --> 05:47.660
Okay.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.700
So here I have one variable that I've defined.

05:50.700 --> 05:58.460
And I'm using that variable to, uh input into this new list or define as a uh, as an element in new

05:58.460 --> 05:59.020
list.

05:59.980 --> 06:00.500
Uh, okay.

06:00.540 --> 06:01.060
Sorry.

06:02.140 --> 06:03.340
Just a little typo there.

06:03.500 --> 06:03.820
Okay.

06:03.860 --> 06:11.220
So you see that these two lists are identical to each other, even though they look different when they

06:11.220 --> 06:12.460
are defined here.

06:12.620 --> 06:16.340
Now why is this a useful way to define a list?

06:16.420 --> 06:18.260
Well, we can do something like this.

06:18.300 --> 06:24.500
I'm adding some spaces and now I'm putting a hashtag here and some info here.

06:24.540 --> 06:30.260
You know, these are just arbitrary, meaningless variables that I'm creating for this little toy demo.

06:30.260 --> 06:38.300
So I don't actually have a lot of information to show, but information here that helps, uh, make

06:38.340 --> 06:42.460
your code be more readable.

06:42.940 --> 06:51.220
Okay, so now you know, you can have comments off to the side that can tell you and also people who

06:51.220 --> 06:57.620
are going to be reading your code and looking at your code, what this variable means, this element

06:57.620 --> 07:01.340
of the list, what this element of the list means, what this means, and so on.

07:01.660 --> 07:08.820
And this is much easier for us humans to understand compared to this list over here.

07:09.820 --> 07:18.010
So the final thing that I want to demonstrate in this video is how to access just this word first in

07:18.010 --> 07:18.450
here.

07:18.770 --> 07:21.890
So we have new list that gives us all of this.

07:21.890 --> 07:27.690
And now if we want to access this list here this is the third element.

07:27.690 --> 07:30.930
So remember we need to index this as two right.

07:30.970 --> 07:34.290
Because this is index zero index one.

07:34.290 --> 07:38.890
And this entire element here which is itself a list is index two.

07:39.290 --> 07:44.850
And now if we want to access this word first we can index that again.

07:45.130 --> 07:45.450
Okay.

07:45.490 --> 07:52.850
So we are indexing into the list and then indexing into the list contained inside a list.

07:53.210 --> 07:55.690
So I hope you're not overwhelmed by lists.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.330
You will use lists a lot.

07:57.370 --> 07:59.810
They use very often in Python coding.

07:59.810 --> 08:06.090
And also in this course they do take a little bit of practice to get used to and to get comfortable

08:06.090 --> 08:12.370
with, but I promise you will understand them and be able to work with them with just a little bit more

08:12.370 --> 08:13.130
practice.
