00:02.080 --> 00:05.520
Before moving on to the next several videos.

00:05.520 --> 00:14.000
In this section, I want to provide a definition and some examples of the distinction between a latent

00:14.000 --> 00:16.440
and a manifest variable.

00:17.120 --> 00:22.680
These are terms in statistics that are important for studying any complex system.

00:23.240 --> 00:30.880
And this distinction is particularly relevant for LMS and mechanistic interpretability, because in

00:30.880 --> 00:38.800
general we are usually not terribly interested in manifest variables themselves, but instead just use

00:38.800 --> 00:45.120
the manifest variables to try to measure or make inferences about latent constructs.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.320
So what do these two terms mean?

00:49.120 --> 00:53.480
A manifest variable is any variable that can be measured.

00:53.880 --> 01:00.560
It is something that you can quantify directly with numbers or that you can represent using numbers.

01:01.170 --> 01:07.970
You can think of variables like salary, height, calories in a meal, the number of seats in a sports

01:07.970 --> 01:13.210
stadium, things in the world that you can directly observe and measure.

01:13.370 --> 01:15.650
Those are manifest variables.

01:16.410 --> 01:24.130
Latent variables, on the other hand, are things that we believe exist, but we cannot directly measure

01:24.130 --> 01:24.530
them.

01:25.170 --> 01:28.530
This is often the case in psychological variables.

01:29.290 --> 01:32.970
For example, think of the concept of attention.

01:33.450 --> 01:38.730
You are probably paying attention right now, but what does attention actually mean?

01:38.970 --> 01:40.130
How do we measure it?

01:40.610 --> 01:47.530
Well, attention is a latent variable because it cannot be directly measured.

01:48.050 --> 01:55.010
We can measure manifest variables that we believe are related to attention, like test performance or

01:55.130 --> 01:56.170
eye movements.

01:56.610 --> 02:01.830
And then we can try to infer attention from the manifest variables.

02:02.350 --> 02:08.310
For example, if you and I are in a conversation face to face and you're looking at me, we're making

02:08.310 --> 02:12.670
eye contact, then I assume that you are paying attention to me.

02:13.230 --> 02:18.870
Of course, latent variables do not necessarily correlate perfectly with manifest variables.

02:19.310 --> 02:21.430
You could be looking directly at me.

02:21.430 --> 02:23.790
You could be making eye contact with me.

02:23.950 --> 02:29.550
That's a manifest variable that I can measure and yet not paying any attention to what I'm saying.

02:30.510 --> 02:34.510
Okay, let me give you a few more examples to make sure this is concrete.

02:35.150 --> 02:41.750
So a manifest variable could be someone's self-reported score on a questionnaire.

02:41.790 --> 02:45.630
For example, the question do you enjoy meeting new people.

02:45.790 --> 02:48.790
And you can answer that between 1 and 9.

02:49.230 --> 02:55.350
Now the thing is no one is really interested in a number to this question.

02:55.870 --> 03:04.920
Instead, people are interested in personality traits such as extraversion, but extraversion is a latent

03:04.920 --> 03:05.640
variable.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.880
It cannot be measured directly.

03:08.240 --> 03:13.920
And, you know, we don't know where in the brain and the body this construct actually exists.

03:14.520 --> 03:21.560
So instead, scientists will measure manifest variables that they believe are related to this latent

03:21.560 --> 03:28.240
construct, and then make inferences about the latent variable based on the manifest variable.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.520
By the way, in the previous slide I called this latent variable.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.240
Here I'm calling it a latent construct.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.240
People use different terms here.

03:38.240 --> 03:44.400
And so I'm going to keep cycling through different terminologies just to make sure you are familiar

03:44.400 --> 03:48.240
with various terms that are used for latent sources.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.960
So here is another example.

03:51.120 --> 03:55.120
There is a latent factor called cardiovascular health.

03:55.560 --> 03:59.960
Lots of people are interested in their cardiovascular health.

04:00.700 --> 04:06.140
and the people who aren't interested probably should be more interested in their cardiovascular health.

04:06.540 --> 04:11.700
But cardiovascular health is not something that we can directly measure or observe.

04:12.300 --> 04:19.220
So instead, you can go to the doctor and measure other manifest variables like heart rate dynamics,

04:19.220 --> 04:20.780
blood pressure, and so on.

04:21.860 --> 04:27.660
So the idea again is that we don't really care about the manifest variables themselves.

04:28.020 --> 04:36.180
Instead, we just use the manifest variables as a way to try to estimate and understand properties of

04:36.180 --> 04:37.740
this latent factor.

04:38.380 --> 04:45.260
So we measure the manifest variables and then we make inferences about the latent factors.

04:46.020 --> 04:49.260
Of course another famous example is intelligence.

04:49.660 --> 04:57.260
We do not really know exactly what intelligence is or what it means for a brain or a person, for it

04:57.260 --> 04:59.700
to be more or less intelligent.

05:00.120 --> 05:07.040
So instead we measure manifest variables like grades in school, performance in exams, maybe other

05:07.040 --> 05:11.280
factors like income or job performance reviews.

05:11.480 --> 05:18.280
And we take those manifest variables as indicators of a latent construct that we call intelligence.

05:19.560 --> 05:26.200
And I am sure that you are fully aware that this is highly imperfect, meaning you can have very intelligent

05:26.200 --> 05:32.840
people who are not successful in a particular job, or maybe they don't do well on a particular exam.

05:33.520 --> 05:39.160
And I'm sure you can also think of some examples of people who are not very intelligent and yet can

05:39.160 --> 05:42.280
become very successful in their career.

05:43.080 --> 05:51.520
Anyway, more germane to llms and interpretability and AI safety, we want to know, for example, what

05:51.560 --> 06:00.290
a given law understands about the world, but we do not know what that means exactly or how to measure

06:00.290 --> 06:00.730
it.

06:00.730 --> 06:06.610
So we do the best we can by measuring manifest variables that we have access to.

06:06.970 --> 06:11.970
For example activation values or output logits for next token predictions.

06:12.730 --> 06:19.850
So these are the quantities in the models that have numbers we can extract and analyze.

06:19.970 --> 06:26.290
And then we use those numbers, perform some statistical analyses and then try to make some inferences

06:26.290 --> 06:31.250
about things that are important to understand, but that we cannot measure directly.

06:31.730 --> 06:38.890
I have stated multiple times that we use manifest variables to make inferences about latent factors.

06:39.890 --> 06:42.210
What does that really mean and how does it work?

06:42.810 --> 06:49.450
So the idea is that there is some latent variable existing in some platonic world.

06:49.850 --> 06:54.170
And we want to understand that latent variable, but we cannot measure it.

06:54.450 --> 06:59.210
But we do have access to lots of manifest variables.

06:59.390 --> 07:06.350
For example, the activations of neurons in an MLP expansion layer in, I don't know, transformer block

07:06.350 --> 07:06.910
seven.

07:07.630 --> 07:15.270
So the idea is that we take this information and we combine it in some way, like taking a linear weighted

07:15.270 --> 07:16.270
combination.

07:16.550 --> 07:19.910
Or perhaps there are some nonlinearities in here as well.

07:20.110 --> 07:24.950
But somehow we statistically pool all of this information together.

07:25.910 --> 07:30.870
And that is our inferred measurement of the latent variable.

07:31.550 --> 07:38.390
Now, there are quite a few possible analysis methods that have been developed in statistics and in

07:38.390 --> 07:42.350
machine learning for estimating latent factors.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.190
And here's a non-exhaustive list of some of them.

07:46.510 --> 07:49.830
These analyses are all different from each other.

07:50.190 --> 07:52.150
They all rely on different equations.

07:52.150 --> 07:58.590
They make different assumptions, and they have different statistical procedures, but they're all focused

07:58.590 --> 08:06.640
on the same goal, which is to transform a collection of manifest variables into a latent factor.

08:08.160 --> 08:15.840
And all of these analyses also suffer from the same fundamental difficulty, which is that these latent

08:15.840 --> 08:22.400
factors are not directly observable, and therefore we can never really know if we are combining the

08:22.400 --> 08:24.800
manifest variables in the right way.

08:25.640 --> 08:28.960
Of course, there are statistical and validity checks.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.480
There are things like common sense and critical thinking.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.960
So it's not like we're completely in the dark about these analyses.

08:35.960 --> 08:43.840
But my point is, it's hard to know if we are applying an analysis that gives us a good approximation

08:44.040 --> 08:49.720
or a bad approximation to the latent variable that we really are interested in.

08:51.080 --> 08:57.000
Now, very often good experiment design and validation in a separate test set.

08:57.120 --> 09:03.460
These are good ways to ascertain the validity of these analyses, but it's just a hard problem in general.

09:04.540 --> 09:11.740
Over the next several videos, I will introduce you to two specific methods for inferring the existence

09:11.740 --> 09:16.500
and dynamics of latent variables based on manifest variables.

09:16.820 --> 09:21.660
Those are sparse autoencoders and generalized eigen decomposition.

09:22.580 --> 09:24.900
So that's it for this overview video.

09:25.140 --> 09:31.620
The important take home point is that estimating latent variables is important but tricky.

09:32.100 --> 09:40.380
That is true in general for any complex system, and it is particularly true in the context of AI safety

09:40.740 --> 09:48.620
because concepts like deception, hallucinations, flattery, and other dangerous behaviors, these

09:48.620 --> 09:56.220
are all latent constructs that cannot be directly measured, but instead must be inferred from model

09:56.220 --> 09:58.180
weights and activations.
