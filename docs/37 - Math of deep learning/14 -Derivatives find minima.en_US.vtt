00:01.880 --> 00:11.120
The main purpose of computing derivatives in the gradient descent algorithm is to identify local minima.

00:11.600 --> 00:19.080
And so in this video I'm going to explain what minima and maxima are, how we use the derivative to

00:19.120 --> 00:27.400
find these critical points, and how to distinguish local minima from local maxima using the derivative.

00:28.160 --> 00:28.440
Okay.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.040
So here we have a graph of a function.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.160
I will show you the formula for this function in a moment.

00:34.160 --> 00:40.000
First let me identify the minima and maxima in this function that we see here.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.320
So here we have two maxima.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.400
And here is a minimum here.

00:44.440 --> 00:47.880
Now there's also kind of minimum points here and here at the edges.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.560
But we will ignore those for now.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.080
So here we see the minimum local minimum of a function.

00:54.360 --> 00:59.000
And here we see two local maxima of this function.

00:59.440 --> 01:04.400
So how do we identify the local minimum and local maximum points.

01:04.600 --> 01:09.640
Well, you know, with a simple function like this, we can just visualize it and you can point at the

01:09.640 --> 01:10.160
graph.

01:10.360 --> 01:12.600
However, it's not always that simple.

01:12.600 --> 01:18.600
We're going to start working with more and more complicated functions that are just too high dimensional

01:18.600 --> 01:19.960
to be visualizable.

01:20.520 --> 01:28.360
So it turns out that the derivative can tell us exactly where these minima and maxima points are.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.760
So here is the derivative.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.640
So this green line shows the derivative of this function.

01:35.080 --> 01:39.240
And now it turns out that all of the extreme points.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.960
So the minima and maxima.

01:41.160 --> 01:45.240
In the parlance of calculus these are called the critical points.

01:45.760 --> 01:49.880
They are associated with a derivative of zero.

01:50.440 --> 01:57.880
So where the function is maximum and where the function is minimum, the derivative has a value of zero.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.400
So we can see that here.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.320
Here's the function in the blue line.

02:01.320 --> 02:07.000
The function is maximum and the derivative in the green line crosses through the zero line.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.230
Same thing here we have a minimum.

02:09.270 --> 02:11.150
The derivative crosses through zero.

02:11.270 --> 02:12.550
Here we have a maximum.

02:12.550 --> 02:15.350
The derivative crosses through zero here.

02:15.870 --> 02:20.150
And this is basically how we identify minima and maxima.

02:20.190 --> 02:23.150
Using calculus we start with the function.

02:23.390 --> 02:25.670
And then we compute its derivative.

02:25.990 --> 02:30.550
And then we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x.

02:30.590 --> 02:37.630
That will tell us all of the points where the derivative is zero, and the points where the derivative

02:37.630 --> 02:41.790
is zero are the points where the function is turning around.

02:41.790 --> 02:46.030
So it's going from positive to negative, or it's going from negative to positive.

02:46.270 --> 02:51.750
And in that transition from positive to negative or from negative to positive, there is necessarily

02:51.750 --> 02:54.350
going to be a local extreme point.

02:54.350 --> 02:57.510
So a local minimum or a local maximum.

02:57.990 --> 02:58.150
Okay.

02:58.190 --> 03:01.110
Now this is a third order polynomial.

03:01.110 --> 03:03.550
So therefore we're going to get three solutions.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.630
And you see all three of those plotted here.

03:05.830 --> 03:08.630
So x equals zero.

03:08.670 --> 03:09.830
That's this point here.

03:09.990 --> 03:13.870
And x equals plus or minus the square root of three over two.

03:13.910 --> 03:16.350
Now, the exact answers don't really matter here.

03:16.350 --> 03:23.110
The point is that we identify the minima and maxima of the function by computing the derivative.

03:23.310 --> 03:30.230
Setting the derivative to zero, and then solving for x that gives us the minimum and the maximum.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.670
Now these points here these are called the critical points.

03:33.670 --> 03:37.630
They don't actually tell us which one is a minimum and which is a maximum.

03:37.790 --> 03:41.670
These just tell us that these are the points where the derivative is zero.

03:42.110 --> 03:45.750
So how can we distinguish between minima and maxima.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.670
That's really important for gradient descent.

03:47.670 --> 03:52.790
We need to know where is the minimum because we want to move towards the minimum.

03:52.790 --> 03:55.950
You learn more about the gradient descent algorithm very soon.

03:55.950 --> 04:00.150
But we want to identify minima and not the maxima.

04:00.510 --> 04:00.710
Okay.

04:00.750 --> 04:06.510
So it turns out that it's actually pretty straightforward to distinguish minimum from maximum points.

04:06.510 --> 04:12.150
And that's really by just looking at the derivative before and after the critical point.

04:12.270 --> 04:14.830
In particular the minima.

04:14.870 --> 04:15.070
Okay.

04:15.110 --> 04:16.030
So this is a repeat the.

04:16.030 --> 04:18.910
The minima and maxima have a derivative.

04:18.950 --> 04:19.750
This is df.

04:19.790 --> 04:22.350
The derivative of the function equals zero.

04:22.750 --> 04:30.670
When we look at the minimum, the minima have a negative derivative to the left and a positive derivative

04:30.670 --> 04:31.550
to the right.

04:31.710 --> 04:37.150
So we can see that in this example we have our derivative equals zero.

04:37.270 --> 04:40.950
When we look to the left the derivative is negative.

04:41.230 --> 04:44.550
And when we look to the right the derivative is positive.

04:44.670 --> 04:48.070
So that means that this is a minimum point.

04:48.870 --> 04:54.270
Conversely, when we look at the maxima we have the exactly the opposite situation.

04:54.270 --> 04:59.470
So the derivative is positive to the left and negative to the right.

04:59.470 --> 05:00.670
So here's the maximum.

05:00.670 --> 05:02.350
Here the derivative is zero.

05:02.590 --> 05:05.630
The derivative is positive before.

05:05.750 --> 05:09.470
So to the left and it is negative after so to the right.

05:09.670 --> 05:13.830
So that is how we distinguish minima from maxima.

05:13.830 --> 05:21.100
And the gradient descent algorithm takes advantage of this fact to to distinguish minima from maxima.

05:21.500 --> 05:25.340
Now there is another case where the derivative is going to be zero.

05:25.780 --> 05:29.060
That actually turns out to be problematic for deep learning.

05:29.300 --> 05:32.380
And to illustrate I will illustrate that on the next slide.

05:32.780 --> 05:36.740
So here's a nice little animated GIF that I found on Wikipedia.

05:37.020 --> 05:42.660
And it shows all of the or shows the three concepts that we've been discussing here.

05:42.780 --> 05:45.140
So the derivative so this is the function.

05:45.140 --> 05:47.860
And we can see the derivative being plotted down here.

05:47.900 --> 05:52.260
Now we don't see the derivative explicitly drawn here as a function.

05:52.460 --> 05:54.860
But this line here this this red.

05:54.900 --> 05:55.540
Now it's green.

05:55.540 --> 06:03.380
Dashed line indicates the slope of the line at each point as this like little trajectory is moving along

06:03.380 --> 06:04.260
the function.

06:04.500 --> 06:08.540
So this is the derivative here indicated graphically.

06:08.540 --> 06:09.900
Here it is numerically.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.300
So let's look at a couple of these points.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.300
Here are minima.

06:13.500 --> 06:19.900
Remember minima are where the derivative is zero and it's negative to the left and positive to the right.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.020
So here it went up to the right.

06:21.020 --> 06:26.660
You see the function is increasing after a minimum, so the derivative is positive.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.740
Here the derivative is negative.

06:28.780 --> 06:33.460
As we go into the minimum it's positive as we come out of the minimum.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.940
Here is a maximum.

06:36.100 --> 06:39.220
Now notice the derivative is going to be positive.

06:39.380 --> 06:42.700
Going into the maximum it's going up slowly.

06:42.900 --> 06:49.980
It's positive going into the maximum because the function is increasing and it's negative coming out

06:50.020 --> 06:55.140
of the maximum because the function is decreasing away from this maximum.

06:55.940 --> 06:56.140
Okay.

06:56.180 --> 06:57.780
And then here's another example up here.

06:58.180 --> 07:03.060
Now there's actually a third case where the derivative is zero.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.300
And it's neither a minimum nor a maximum.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.540
That's going to happen right here.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.420
Notice this is going to go to zero.

07:09.420 --> 07:11.900
Here the derivative will go to zero.

07:12.380 --> 07:13.740
And now the function.

07:13.860 --> 07:14.500
Here it is.

07:14.860 --> 07:18.140
The function is not at a minimum or a maximum.

07:18.140 --> 07:21.420
Instead the function is at a flat area.

07:21.420 --> 07:24.140
The function is continuous or constant here.

07:24.700 --> 07:30.930
Now this actually turns out to be a pretty significant potential issue for deep learning.

07:31.130 --> 07:35.130
This is called vanishing gradient when you get to a situation like this.

07:35.570 --> 07:37.130
This is called a vanishing gradient.

07:37.130 --> 07:41.930
We are going to learn exactly why this happens and why it's a problem.

07:42.090 --> 07:49.890
Fortunately, it's actually relatively straightforward to solve this vanishing gradient problem in deep

07:49.890 --> 07:51.730
learning using some tricks.

07:51.730 --> 07:57.370
But just to give you a bit of a heads up already to what this vanishing gradient means, it's where

07:57.370 --> 08:03.930
the derivative is zero, but we're not at a minimum and we're not at a maximum.

08:04.730 --> 08:11.450
So in this video, you learned about the main purpose of using derivatives in the gradient descent algorithm,

08:11.450 --> 08:12.930
which you will learn about very soon.

08:13.290 --> 08:20.450
You learned what minima and maxima are, how to use the derivative to identify minima and maxima points,

08:20.450 --> 08:24.650
and how to distinguish a minimum from a maximum.

08:24.650 --> 08:29.890
All of these are prerequisite knowledge for understanding how gradient descent works.
