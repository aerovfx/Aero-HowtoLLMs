00:02.000 --> 00:06.240
In this video, I will introduce you to the transpose operation.

00:06.520 --> 00:13.560
This is a very simple, very straightforward, easy to understand operation in linear algebra, but

00:13.560 --> 00:14.800
it's super important.

00:14.800 --> 00:18.120
And so I will show you first the math in the slides.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.600
And then we'll switch to Python.

00:19.600 --> 00:26.120
And I'll show you how to transpose vectors and matrices in NumPy and in PyTorch.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.560
So let's get started.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.880
Here we have a column vector.

00:30.280 --> 00:37.360
And then we are going to transpose this column vector transpose operation is often indicated using a

00:37.400 --> 00:40.200
capital T in the superscript.

00:40.560 --> 00:45.120
So transposing means converting rows into columns and columns into rows.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.880
So here we have a column vector.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.680
Here we have a row vector resulting from the transpose operation.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.160
Notice that all of the elements are the same.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.320
The order of the numbers is the same.

00:56.320 --> 01:03.130
So we're not really changing the information that's contained Inside of this vector, we are only changing

01:03.130 --> 01:04.210
the orientation.

01:04.210 --> 01:05.530
So column to row.

01:05.930 --> 01:08.410
Now you can transpose a row vector.

01:08.690 --> 01:12.530
And that's going to bring us back to our original column vector.

01:12.690 --> 01:14.850
So transposing a transpose.

01:14.850 --> 01:18.690
In other words double transposing undoes the original transpose.

01:18.690 --> 01:22.130
So double transpose you get back to the original vector.

01:22.450 --> 01:26.570
Now transposing a matrix is the same concept.

01:26.570 --> 01:33.690
You just have to be a little bit more mindful of which of preserving the column order into the rows.

01:33.970 --> 01:38.530
So when we transpose this matrix, it becomes this other matrix.

01:38.530 --> 01:42.050
This is now a matrix with two long columns.

01:42.050 --> 01:43.530
Here we have two long rows.

01:43.930 --> 01:49.570
Now the tricky thing is just to remember that the first column turns into the first row.

01:49.850 --> 01:55.130
So, you know, if you would visualize this as you know, the T here being a pivot, and then you swivel

01:55.170 --> 01:59.570
the matrix up like this, if you would rotate this matrix, that's actually incorrect.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.660
because then the second column would be the first row.

02:02.860 --> 02:06.420
So make sure that the first column becomes the first row.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.540
The second column becomes the second row.

02:08.740 --> 02:13.900
Of course, this would continue for however many columns you have in this matrix would be rows in this

02:13.900 --> 02:14.500
matrix.

02:14.740 --> 02:22.460
Now, you will not be surprised to learn that the transpose of a transpose matrix is gives us back the

02:22.460 --> 02:23.620
original matrix.

02:23.620 --> 02:26.980
So again, double transposing gives us back the same thing.

02:27.380 --> 02:32.700
Now I will switch to Python and show you how to implement the transpose operation.

02:33.860 --> 02:39.740
I'm going to show you the transpose operation in numpy and in PyTorch.

02:40.100 --> 02:43.940
So I run this cell to well it has to connect to the server.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.700
Um, and uh yeah.

02:45.740 --> 02:50.620
Then have all of the libraries being imported at the top of the code here.

02:51.060 --> 02:53.220
And here I'm going to show you first using numpy.

02:53.420 --> 02:55.740
So let's create a vector.

02:55.780 --> 02:59.420
Now remember this is called an array in numpy.

02:59.550 --> 03:02.590
but in linear algebra we would call this a vector.

03:02.870 --> 03:05.270
So you can see this is a row vector right.

03:05.270 --> 03:07.190
We have the parentheses here.

03:07.390 --> 03:10.110
That's for the function numpy array.

03:10.550 --> 03:12.870
And then we have one set of square brackets.

03:12.870 --> 03:15.590
And that indicates that we want to input an array.

03:15.910 --> 03:19.270
And then we have another square set of square brackets.

03:19.270 --> 03:21.750
And this is used to indicate the first row.

03:22.150 --> 03:24.790
So this is the first row of the matrix.

03:24.790 --> 03:28.670
And then this is indicating that we are inputting a matrix.

03:28.670 --> 03:31.430
And then we have the function call over here.

03:31.710 --> 03:32.070
All right.

03:32.070 --> 03:36.990
So print out this variable NP for numpy vector.

03:37.230 --> 03:38.710
And then I'm going to transpose it.

03:38.710 --> 03:42.390
So in numpy there's actually a couple of ways you can transpose a vector.

03:42.590 --> 03:48.150
You can write numpy transpose NV like this so that you can use that to transpose.

03:48.150 --> 03:51.030
But it's more common to just write dot t.

03:51.070 --> 03:55.230
So this is a method on numpy array objects.

03:55.230 --> 03:57.910
So dot t will transpose the vector.

03:58.230 --> 04:03.990
Now here I'm not actually transposing the vector permanently, I'm only printing it out.

04:04.030 --> 04:04.710
Transpose.

04:04.710 --> 04:10.950
So this code here doesn't actually change the original orientation of variable NV.

04:11.510 --> 04:17.070
So here I'm creating a new vector NV which is equal to the transpose.

04:17.110 --> 04:18.270
And then I transpose that again.

04:18.270 --> 04:25.430
That's just to show you that the original row vector becomes a column vector when it's transposed.

04:25.550 --> 04:31.230
And then we set that to be a, we set that transpose vector to be its own variable.

04:31.390 --> 04:33.110
And then we transpose that back.

04:33.150 --> 04:36.470
And that gives us back our original row vector.

04:37.230 --> 04:37.470
Okay.

04:37.510 --> 04:38.950
So that was for a vector.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.670
Now I'm going to repeat exactly the same thing.

04:41.670 --> 04:44.950
All this code is exactly the same except for here.

04:44.990 --> 04:46.630
Now this is a matrix.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.190
So this is a two row matrix.

04:49.230 --> 04:51.070
It's a two by four matrix.

04:51.110 --> 04:56.230
It might be easier to visualize if you use multiple lines here like this.

04:56.230 --> 05:04.000
So now you see that this is a matrix that comprises two rows, and each row has two, uh, sorry, four

05:04.000 --> 05:04.680
columns.

05:05.160 --> 05:05.360
Okay.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.960
So we run this code and then you see here's our original matrix here.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.280
We transposed it again.

05:11.280 --> 05:16.000
Like I mentioned in the video, the first row becomes the first column.

05:16.160 --> 05:20.480
And then when we transpose it back, the first column becomes the first row.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.480
And of course same for the second column and the second row.

05:24.000 --> 05:24.240
Okay.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.800
So that's using PyTorch.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.880
Now I started using numpy.

05:27.920 --> 05:33.400
Now I'm going to show you the same operation, the same mathematical operation, but using PyTorch.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.440
Fortunately this one is the same.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.120
Almost the same.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.160
We specify the data type differently.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.480
This is fortunate because there are other cases.

05:42.480 --> 05:50.120
There are other situations where the syntax or the notation is different between NumPy and PyTorch.

05:50.120 --> 05:54.000
So sometimes numpy and PyTorch work basically the same.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.040
Sometimes they work a little bit differently.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.650
This is a case where they are more or less the same.

05:58.650 --> 06:04.290
We just define this as a torch tensor instead of numpy dot array.

06:04.890 --> 06:08.050
Otherwise it's the code is exactly the same.

06:08.250 --> 06:08.970
You can see also.

06:08.970 --> 06:11.490
This is showing us that we have a tensor here.

06:11.490 --> 06:13.090
So this is a PyTorch tensor.

06:13.210 --> 06:15.090
But yeah otherwise it's the same.

06:15.130 --> 06:17.370
Okay then repeat for a matrix.

06:17.370 --> 06:20.930
And again this is the same code as with numpy.

06:21.290 --> 06:23.050
We just have PyTorch tensors.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.290
So these are a different data type.

06:25.730 --> 06:30.850
And just to show you that this is a different data type, here I'm printing out the names of the different

06:30.850 --> 06:35.090
variables and the types of each of those variables.

06:35.770 --> 06:39.370
So then you see this is a numpy ndarray.

06:39.370 --> 06:44.090
Remember I said before that the ND is for n dimensional.

06:44.090 --> 06:48.570
So this is stored internally as a multi-dimensional array.

06:48.970 --> 06:51.490
And here these other variables starting with T.

06:51.530 --> 06:53.410
These are the ones I created with PyTorch.

06:53.570 --> 06:56.010
And these are of type torch tensor.
