00:01.520 --> 00:09.240
The goal of this video is to introduce you to some important terminology in linear algebra and computer

00:09.240 --> 00:12.680
science, in particular as it relates to deep learning.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.160
So let's dive right in.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.720
Here we have a collections of numbers.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.320
And those are the objects.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.200
And here are the names.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.640
Now this is linear algebra terminology.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.920
This is what you would call these things in linear algebra.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.600
So one number all on its own is called a scalar.

00:29.960 --> 00:37.200
It's called a scalar because of the geometric interpretation of linear algebra where individual numbers

00:37.200 --> 00:41.080
are used to stretch or shrink a vector.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.400
So a single number just on its own that's called a scalar.

00:44.720 --> 00:48.840
A vector is either a column or a row of numbers.

00:48.840 --> 00:52.000
So you can see this is like one physical dimension.

00:52.480 --> 00:57.720
The term dimensionality gets a little complicated in linear algebra, but it's one physical dimension

00:57.720 --> 01:00.160
because it's just a list of numbers.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.770
So we call this a vector.

01:01.930 --> 01:03.370
This will be a column vector.

01:03.450 --> 01:05.210
We also have row vectors that will.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.050
This is a matrix.

01:06.050 --> 01:10.610
But if you would just isolate this first row you can see this would be a row vector.

01:10.610 --> 01:15.370
So column vector is standing up a row vector is laying down on its side.

01:15.770 --> 01:16.650
So this is a vector.

01:16.690 --> 01:20.970
A matrix is a two dimensional spreadsheet of numbers.

01:20.970 --> 01:27.810
So this is you can think of numbers arranged in like Excel in Excel spreadsheet for example, that we

01:27.810 --> 01:29.090
call a matrix.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.730
And anything higher dimensional we call a tensor.

01:33.010 --> 01:36.050
Here I'm depicting a three dimensional tensor.

01:36.050 --> 01:38.770
So this would be like a cube of numbers.

01:38.770 --> 01:42.810
You can imagine one of these things and then you know repeat it multiple times.

01:43.130 --> 01:45.690
So here we have a three dimensional tensor.

01:45.890 --> 01:47.770
And you can also have higher dimensional.

01:47.770 --> 01:50.290
You can have 4 or 5 six dimensional tensors.

01:50.650 --> 01:56.090
In data analysis and signal processing we work with tensors all the time in physics.

01:56.090 --> 01:57.730
They also work with tensors a lot.

01:58.250 --> 02:03.060
Next bit of terminology is the phrase or the term data type.

02:03.460 --> 02:08.900
Now data type means something different in computer science versus in statistics.

02:09.100 --> 02:14.020
So I have this slide here because, you know, some people are coming to this course with a background

02:14.020 --> 02:15.300
in computer science.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.780
So this is what you think of with data type.

02:17.780 --> 02:23.540
And some people come from a background in statistics or biology or psychology.

02:24.340 --> 02:27.540
So you're probably thinking about this kind of data type.

02:27.660 --> 02:32.460
So data type in computer science refers to the format of data storage.

02:32.500 --> 02:38.940
It has implications for the kinds of operations that you can perform between two different variables

02:38.940 --> 02:40.700
how information is stored.

02:41.020 --> 02:44.540
And some examples are like floating point numbers booleans strings.

02:44.540 --> 02:47.020
These are different data types in computer science.

02:47.020 --> 02:47.860
On computers.

02:48.260 --> 02:52.620
In statistics, a data type refers to the category of data.

02:52.780 --> 02:56.500
This describes which statistical procedures you can use.

02:56.780 --> 03:00.180
Examples are categorical, numerical ratio, and so on.

03:00.380 --> 03:06.510
Now it turns out that, fortunately, we don't need to worry about this ambiguity in this course, because

03:06.830 --> 03:13.550
every time I use the term data type in the rest of this course, I'm only referring to the computer

03:13.550 --> 03:14.990
science interpretation.

03:14.990 --> 03:20.910
So if you're coming from if you're coming from a computer science or engineering background, then you

03:20.950 --> 03:22.790
just ignore all this stuff on the right.

03:22.790 --> 03:24.030
It's just going to confuse you.

03:24.270 --> 03:29.190
If you're coming from a stats background and this is what you think of when you think of data type,

03:29.310 --> 03:35.190
then also don't worry about this data type is just going to mean things like representing numbers in

03:35.190 --> 03:40.750
Python, using floating point precision or integers or booleans and things like that.

03:41.230 --> 03:45.350
So for example, these two numbers here have different data types.

03:45.510 --> 03:46.510
This is an integer.

03:46.510 --> 03:48.310
This is a floating point number.

03:48.670 --> 03:53.510
And when we get to Python then yeah there's also different data types in Python.

03:53.510 --> 03:54.590
So this is a list.

03:54.790 --> 03:56.270
This is a numpy array.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.190
This is a PyTorch tensor.

03:58.550 --> 04:05.590
So the numerical values that each of these things are representing is the same, but the data type,

04:05.590 --> 04:09.110
the way that they are stored and represented on computers is different.

04:09.150 --> 04:16.390
Now this is important because different operations will only work on, uh, sometimes different operations

04:16.390 --> 04:19.230
only work on specific data types.

04:19.230 --> 04:25.030
So you will come across instances where we need to convert lists into numpy arrays.

04:25.230 --> 04:29.310
There's going to be other operations that we try to do in PyTorch that won't work.

04:29.510 --> 04:33.190
We'll get errors because the data type is numpy.

04:33.230 --> 04:39.790
But PyTorch wants wants to work with PyTorch tensors, even though the values, the numbers are the

04:39.790 --> 04:42.550
same, the data type is important.

04:42.990 --> 04:46.830
So on that note, now I need to show you this slide again.

04:46.830 --> 04:49.710
Now this is not only linear algebra terminology.

04:49.830 --> 04:50.630
Here in the top row.

04:50.670 --> 04:52.910
This is the linear algebra terminology.

04:53.230 --> 04:57.030
Here I have the corresponding numpy and PyTorch terminology.

04:57.390 --> 05:01.120
So PyTorch numpy calls this thing an array.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.240
So vectors are called an array.

05:03.240 --> 05:06.440
And then matrices and tensors we get into ndarray.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.800
This is n is for the number of dimensions.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.520
So we have a multi-dimensional array.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.720
And that's what numpy calls matrices and tensors.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.040
And PyTorch with a data type is tensors.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.360
So PyTorch is just going to call all of these things tensors.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.480
We're going to convert.

05:23.520 --> 05:30.760
Even individual numbers are going to be stored using the data type in PyTorch the data type Torch.tensor.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.720
Now this is not something that you need to worry about right now.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.760
You don't need to be concerned about this now.

05:36.760 --> 05:43.160
I'm just giving you a heads up because this is going to become important later on when we start getting

05:43.200 --> 05:47.880
into the details of implementing deep learning in PyTorch and NumPy.

05:48.440 --> 05:55.400
So in this video you learned about different terminology for collections of numbers in linear algebra

05:55.560 --> 05:59.440
and on computers, and with NumPy and PyTorch.
