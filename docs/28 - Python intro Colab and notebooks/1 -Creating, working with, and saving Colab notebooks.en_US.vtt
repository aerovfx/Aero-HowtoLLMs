00:00.800 --> 00:09.280
In this video, I will introduce you to using the colab environment that is provided by Google and connects

00:09.280 --> 00:17.440
to not only Python back end, but also GPUs that we can use for investigating and building and training

00:17.440 --> 00:18.960
large language models.

00:19.200 --> 00:26.800
Okay, so to get to Colab, first of all, you need a Google account that is free to open and then you

00:26.800 --> 00:30.680
can go to Colab.research.google.com.

00:31.040 --> 00:38.200
Or you can just Google search for Colab research, and then you will find it and you open up a new notebook

00:38.240 --> 00:40.480
and you will get something that looks like this.

00:40.520 --> 00:46.560
It's always very intimidating to see these empty files, whether it's like a word doc and you have to

00:46.560 --> 00:48.840
write something or a code file.

00:49.240 --> 00:53.760
But don't worry, we will fill all this stuff in with beautiful, amazing code.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.720
Okay, so this is one option to go directly to this website

01:01.880 --> 01:08.680
You can also open up new notebook files in Colab if you are in Google Drive.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.640
So here I'm at my drive.

01:10.640 --> 01:15.320
I've created a folder for this LM course and now there's nothing in here.

01:15.320 --> 01:20.960
But I am going to right click and more and then you will see Google Colab.

01:20.960 --> 01:29.080
So that is just another way to automatically create an empty Python notebook file in this folder.

01:29.080 --> 01:33.920
And then it will immediately open it up in Colab, like what you see here.

01:34.200 --> 01:42.240
Okay, so if this is your first time ever looking at a colab notebook, then I encourage you to take

01:42.240 --> 01:47.480
a few minutes just to browse around and see what is available in these notebooks.

01:47.480 --> 01:52.880
So for example, we can go to open we can open a new notebook.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.160
So you have several possibilities for opening notebooks.

01:56.560 --> 02:00.090
You can open an existing notebook from your Google Drive.

02:00.130 --> 02:03.850
This is useful when you already have several notebooks available.

02:04.410 --> 02:06.930
Here's a nice feature we can cancel this.

02:06.970 --> 02:09.650
Don't actually need to connect to GitHub right now.

02:09.890 --> 02:14.090
So if you select GitHub then here you can enter a GitHub repo.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.330
So for example I will just search for my own.

02:16.930 --> 02:20.650
And here so this is for my GitHub site.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.090
And then you can see all the repos that I have here.

02:24.090 --> 02:28.690
So for example I don't know let's do uh this one calculus book.

02:29.730 --> 02:32.370
So now I can click on one of these files.

02:32.370 --> 02:34.810
And that will just automatically open.

02:34.810 --> 02:40.530
So it pulls the notebook file off of GitHub and it will open it here.

02:40.530 --> 02:47.730
So then yeah we can start working with this notebook file here that I have gotten from GitHub.

02:48.010 --> 02:50.010
Now don't worry if you make changes here.

02:50.010 --> 02:53.610
That's not actually going to change the file on my GitHub.

02:53.770 --> 02:57.850
You can save this after modifying it, you can save it locally.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.890
Okay, but that's not what I want to do here.

02:59.890 --> 03:04.130
What I want to do is just open up a fresh notebook here.

03:04.130 --> 03:05.490
So I'm going to close this.

03:05.530 --> 03:09.130
It's giving me a warning message because I've made changes but that's fine.

03:09.970 --> 03:10.250
Okay.

03:10.290 --> 03:16.010
So here I have my beautifully titled, very clear titled notebook here.

03:16.250 --> 03:16.530
Okay.

03:16.570 --> 03:19.290
Anyway, so that was about opening notebooks.

03:19.650 --> 03:26.330
Um, you can also, once you've been working on a notebook, you can save a copy in your Google Drive.

03:26.490 --> 03:30.450
If you have a GitHub account, you can save it directly in GitHub.

03:30.450 --> 03:35.810
You can also download the file either as a notebook or as a raw Python file.

03:36.290 --> 03:43.050
To be honest, if you are watching this video then it means you are probably fairly new, maybe completely

03:43.050 --> 03:45.570
new, but at least a little bit new to Python.

03:46.570 --> 03:53.530
In which case I recommend not worrying about downloading to locally and also not worrying about saving

03:53.570 --> 03:54.450
to a GitHub.

03:54.450 --> 03:59.330
Instead, I recommend keeping all these files organized on your Google Drive.

03:59.930 --> 04:03.050
Certainly for now it just makes things a little bit easier.

04:03.490 --> 04:08.530
Other menu options you probably don't really need to worry about here is a relevant one.

04:08.530 --> 04:10.210
If you click on runtime.

04:10.370 --> 04:14.210
Then we look down to the option change runtime type.

04:14.650 --> 04:18.290
So by default you get connected to a CPU.

04:18.290 --> 04:23.250
So we're not yet connected to a CPU, but we will in a moment.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.370
And that is going to connect us to Python.

04:26.410 --> 04:29.490
You know Google Colab supports some other languages as well.

04:29.490 --> 04:32.690
But here we're only going to be working with Python.

04:33.130 --> 04:33.690
Uh, yeah.

04:33.690 --> 04:40.410
So by default you get access to a CPU, which is great for lots and lots of applications, lots and

04:40.410 --> 04:42.050
lots of explorations.

04:42.250 --> 04:48.930
Once we start getting into working with large, large language models, then we're going to need to

04:48.930 --> 04:50.010
switch to GPUs.

04:50.250 --> 04:58.940
Now depending on your location and whether you pay for Colab Pro, you might only see you know.

04:58.980 --> 05:04.820
You might not see as many GPU options here, but you'll certainly have at least one GPU option.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.980
And so yeah, I'll talk about this more later in the course.

05:08.980 --> 05:14.380
But basically, when you are working with these really large deep learning models, you really need

05:14.380 --> 05:15.380
to use the GPU.

05:15.420 --> 05:22.540
This is going to be the difference between waiting seconds versus waiting hours for your model to process.

05:23.020 --> 05:28.980
Okay, but all that said, if you do not need to use a GPU, then you should stick to the CPU.

05:29.020 --> 05:33.300
The CPU is better to connect to unless you really need the GPU.

05:33.780 --> 05:36.980
Okay, uh, let's see, there's also some options here.

05:37.300 --> 05:40.020
Uh, but I'm not going to.

05:40.060 --> 05:45.260
Yeah, we don't really need to worry about these options for the moment, but there are some interesting

05:45.260 --> 05:52.140
things to work with here on the left side panel, like exploring the files that we are creating, but

05:52.140 --> 05:53.580
we will get to that later.

05:53.860 --> 05:56.660
Okay, so now this is a code cell.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.980
This is called a code cell that is grayed out area.

05:58.980 --> 06:05.980
In here we can add more code cells either through let's see insert code cell.

06:06.460 --> 06:11.860
You can also if you mouse over the top or the bottom, that will give you an option to add more code

06:11.860 --> 06:12.940
cells like this.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.620
You can do these anywhere.

06:14.660 --> 06:16.300
You can also add text cells.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.820
That is for making notes for yourself.

06:18.820 --> 06:22.820
If you want to make longer notes, you know notes go here okay.

06:23.340 --> 06:26.180
And then yeah you can also like stylize these and so on.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.580
Add pictures and whatever.

06:27.940 --> 06:33.540
But mostly you know, most of these cells in your notebook file will be code files.

06:33.980 --> 06:37.220
So these are the cells that you write code into.

06:37.340 --> 06:38.860
So your code will go here.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.220
You can start off very simple.

06:40.260 --> 06:42.700
Just four plus four okay.

06:42.740 --> 06:49.020
Now the way to think about so you can add multiple code cells and multiple lines of code in one code

06:49.020 --> 06:49.380
cell.

06:49.660 --> 06:55.580
The way to think about a code cell is like a paragraph in a text.

06:55.860 --> 06:56.780
So you.

06:56.820 --> 07:00.500
If you're writing a text, if you're writing a document, you have words.

07:00.500 --> 07:04.700
And you know, these individual little pieces of code are kind of like words.

07:04.980 --> 07:12.460
And you have sentences which is kind of like a line of code, and then you have paragraphs, and a paragraph

07:12.460 --> 07:16.100
would be like this entire code cell here.

07:16.340 --> 07:20.420
So this is something to keep in mind when you're organizing your code.

07:20.420 --> 07:26.780
If you have hundreds of lines of code, you probably don't want it all to go in one code cell.

07:27.380 --> 07:36.140
Just like if you are writing a document or report, you don't want to have, you know, a 5000 word

07:36.140 --> 07:36.620
essay.

07:36.660 --> 07:38.220
That's just one paragraph.

07:38.220 --> 07:40.540
So you separate out things, okay?

07:40.580 --> 07:47.940
And then you can also use these text cells to separate sections so you can say, you know, this section

07:48.140 --> 07:53.020
involves training a language model.

07:53.260 --> 07:53.580
Okay.

07:53.620 --> 07:58.180
So now and then below, you know, maybe we have some more code in here.

07:58.220 --> 08:00.500
And then below we're going to have another section.

08:00.660 --> 08:06.940
And it's going to be this section involves testing a trained model something like this.

08:08.180 --> 08:08.660
Okay.

08:09.060 --> 08:15.020
So then you know this is just a way to help you organize your code and help you see where you are.

08:15.420 --> 08:22.500
So now I have written some Python code, but right now this is not actually connected to a Python server.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.820
We're not actually running any code.

08:24.820 --> 08:26.900
I've just written some text in here.

08:27.100 --> 08:31.220
What we need to do is connect our notebook here.

08:31.220 --> 08:38.380
This, you know, just this text here to a Python server that's sitting, you know, in a cloud server

08:38.380 --> 08:39.060
somewhere.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.940
I don't know where Google stores all these different servers.

08:42.260 --> 08:42.500
Okay.

08:42.540 --> 08:45.470
There's a couple of ways that you can connect to a server.

08:45.670 --> 08:48.310
One is by clicking this button over here.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.910
So you say it's going to say a couple of different things.

08:50.910 --> 08:54.110
It might say connect or unconnected or reconnect.

08:54.790 --> 09:00.230
It actually automatically connected when I opened up this tab a few minutes ago.

09:00.550 --> 09:02.950
So now yeah you can see now it's connecting.

09:03.030 --> 09:08.590
If you are not connected over here, you just click this button and it will automatically connect.

09:08.910 --> 09:09.750
So this is great.

09:09.790 --> 09:13.110
Now we are actually connected to a compute engine back end.

09:13.150 --> 09:17.590
This means we can start running the code that we have written here.

09:17.910 --> 09:21.630
Now if you don't know anything about Python code, that's fine.

09:21.630 --> 09:25.470
You're going to learn about that in, you know, starting in the next video.

09:25.710 --> 09:32.590
But what the idea is that you put your code as text into each of these cells, and then you actually

09:32.630 --> 09:38.070
evaluate, you tell Python to run that code by in a number of ways.

09:38.070 --> 09:40.990
So you can press this little button over here.

09:41.630 --> 09:46.470
It tells you how long it took to get the green check mark, indicating that the code cell was run.

09:47.510 --> 09:50.790
It took zero seconds and it output.

09:50.830 --> 09:51.670
It gave an output.

09:51.710 --> 09:56.230
Now, code cells don't always give an output, but sometimes they do.

09:56.270 --> 09:56.550
Okay.

09:56.590 --> 09:58.390
So you can click this button here.

09:58.630 --> 10:01.870
There's keyboard shortcuts that you can use on the Mac.

10:01.910 --> 10:05.310
It is command enter that also runs the cell.

10:05.350 --> 10:10.750
And notice that the cursor stayed in here on Windows and Linux it would be a control enter.

10:11.510 --> 10:14.270
Another keyboard shortcut is shift enter.

10:14.390 --> 10:17.750
So when I press shift enter watch what happens to the cursor.

10:17.750 --> 10:18.870
Now it's in this cell.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.990
And now I press shift enter.

10:21.190 --> 10:22.750
It runs this code.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.630
And then it moved the cursor to the next cell.

10:25.870 --> 10:25.990
Okay.

10:26.030 --> 10:29.070
And you can see there I go to the next cell and the next cell and the next cell.

10:29.510 --> 10:29.790
Okay.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.470
And then let me put something in here.

10:31.670 --> 10:32.630
Uh, junk code.

10:32.630 --> 10:33.910
This is not real code.

10:34.190 --> 10:36.190
I just want something in here for you to see.

10:36.230 --> 10:40.190
Okay, so if I press shift enter, then I go to the next cell.

10:40.310 --> 10:48.990
There's another option, which is to press either option, enter on the Mac or Alt, enter on a Windows

10:48.990 --> 10:54.430
or Linux computer, and then it runs the current code cell and it adds a new one.

10:54.430 --> 10:59.430
So you see we got this new code cell that is before this one over here.

11:00.030 --> 11:00.350
Okay.

11:00.390 --> 11:03.190
So that's about running the code in this cell.

11:03.510 --> 11:09.870
Uh, the last uh well, one more thing I want to show you is that sometimes it happens that your Python

11:10.390 --> 11:12.870
session just gets really zonked up.

11:12.870 --> 11:15.710
So sometimes just everything is going wrong.

11:15.710 --> 11:21.430
You don't know what the problem is, and you just want to clear the workspace and start again.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.270
You want to delete your session.

11:23.270 --> 11:28.590
So there's a couple of different ways you can just, you know, nuclear attack everything and start

11:28.590 --> 11:29.710
again from scratch.

11:29.910 --> 11:34.790
You can click up to runtime and you can do restart session.

11:35.310 --> 11:38.120
Uh, that is one option that will.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.000
You can see this warning message.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.560
Are you sure you want to restart?

11:41.840 --> 11:45.280
This will basically delete all the local variables.

11:45.280 --> 11:51.680
So all the variables that you've created, all the work that you've done in Python is going to be deleted.

11:51.760 --> 11:56.080
Now, just to be super duper clear, nothing happens to the code.

11:56.080 --> 11:56.640
You'll see this.

11:56.640 --> 11:57.680
Now I say yes.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.800
Nothing happens to the code.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.600
Your code is perfectly safe.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.760
Nothing happens to any of the text in this file.

12:05.040 --> 12:12.280
What gets deleted is all the variables that you've created, all of the settings that you have defined,

12:12.320 --> 12:14.280
all the parameters that you've defined.

12:14.400 --> 12:19.920
So all of the variables that you created, things you might have imported from online or from other

12:19.920 --> 12:23.680
libraries, those all get reset when you do that option.

12:24.560 --> 12:31.360
Another option for resetting Python is if you click on this arrow up here and you can say disconnect

12:31.360 --> 12:36.000
and delete runtime again, that will give you this warning message.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.360
All of the local variables will be lost.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.280
Your code does not get lost.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.800
Nothing happens to your code.

12:41.800 --> 12:42.960
Your code is safe.

12:43.240 --> 12:47.720
It's just all of the work that you've done in Python gets deleted.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.600
Okay, but sometimes you need to do that.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.280
All right.

12:51.560 --> 12:57.720
The last thing I want to show you here is how to change the name of these files.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.640
So you can see the file names up here.

13:00.120 --> 13:04.160
Untitled five is a terrible name for a file.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.440
So you want to call this?

13:05.480 --> 13:10.520
You know, my work is great.

13:10.560 --> 13:10.840
Okay.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.760
This is also not a great file name.

13:13.240 --> 13:19.760
How about something like, uh, learn Python variables?

13:19.800 --> 13:24.720
Okay, so this might be what you call the notebook file for the next video.

13:25.080 --> 13:25.360
Okay.

13:25.440 --> 13:29.160
And you want to leave this extension here Ipynb.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.520
This stands for interactive.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.880
The I is for interactive.

13:32.920 --> 13:37.080
The Pi is for Python and the NB is for notebook.

13:37.240 --> 13:43.080
So that is a specific file name that goes with these kinds of notebooks.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.640
Oh, I forgot there was one more thing I wanted to show you.

13:46.640 --> 13:52.480
And that is if you go to tools and then settings here you can change some notebook settings.

13:52.680 --> 13:59.320
So for example, when I record these videos I use a large font because I want to make sure you can see

13:59.320 --> 14:04.440
all of you know everything that I'm typing, regardless of your screen size.

14:04.440 --> 14:07.640
But you know, this is a little bit big if you're just working on your own.

14:07.640 --> 14:11.480
So maybe you want, you know, something like this, maybe that's a better thing.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.440
And then, you know, you can also explore some other options.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.880
There is, for example, AI assistants.

14:18.440 --> 14:26.240
I prefer to hide the AI features, the generative AI features while I'm teaching, just because I find

14:26.240 --> 14:29.760
it gets distracting and annoying, both for me and for you.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.370
But maybe that's something you want to play around with and.

14:33.410 --> 14:33.690
Yeah.

14:33.730 --> 14:34.130
Okay.

14:34.490 --> 14:40.610
So, um, then we are happy with this, and I just want to move it somewhere.

14:40.610 --> 14:44.170
So you can see in this folder that I created in the beginning of this video.

14:44.370 --> 14:45.890
I still don't see this file.

14:45.890 --> 14:47.570
So where actually is this file.

14:47.570 --> 14:48.570
Where did it go.

14:48.770 --> 14:50.090
Where is this stored?

14:50.370 --> 14:53.610
Uh, so we can say, uh, we can move this file.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.890
You can save it as save a copy in your drive.

14:57.010 --> 15:01.050
Or if this is somewhere else in your drive, you can move it and then, uh.

15:01.050 --> 15:01.290
Yeah.

15:01.330 --> 15:01.690
Let's see.

15:01.690 --> 15:05.890
I'm going to put it in this folder LM course.

15:06.090 --> 15:07.450
And now it's saved over there.

15:07.450 --> 15:10.290
Now I can go back here and I see this file here.

15:10.610 --> 15:14.090
So now in the future now I'm going to close this in the future.

15:14.370 --> 15:19.890
Uh, you can come back to your Google drive over here, and you can either double click on this file

15:19.890 --> 15:24.890
or, uh, open with Google Colab and that will open it up again.

15:25.450 --> 15:25.970
There we go.

15:25.970 --> 15:28.290
Now we have our original file back.
