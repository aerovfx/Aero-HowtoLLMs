00:00.440 --> 00:08.400
I'd like to begin this video by reminding you of this error message that we found in the previous video.

00:08.560 --> 00:16.680
So here I said, if you want to extract information from multiple indices at the same time, you would,

00:16.720 --> 00:21.120
you know, you might want to use a format like this, but that actually doesn't work.

00:21.280 --> 00:21.600
Okay.

00:21.640 --> 00:31.960
So slicing is one of the ways that we can extract information from multiple elements in a list simultaneously.

00:32.240 --> 00:32.640
Okay.

00:32.680 --> 00:36.200
So it's not quite this method, but it's something similar.

00:36.560 --> 00:36.800
Okay.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.360
Let's see.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.840
Uh, I'm going to start by creating a list.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.440
Let's call this variable about y.

00:42.880 --> 00:46.880
So y equals range 5 to 11.

00:46.880 --> 00:52.080
Now in the last video I showed you range with one input that was just like this.

00:53.080 --> 00:59.200
And that after we converted it into a list that returned the integers zero through four.

00:59.680 --> 01:05.280
And now I'm going to show you a slightly different way of using range, which is to provide two inputs.

01:05.280 --> 01:09.600
So I have the number five and then a comma to separate the inputs.

01:09.920 --> 01:12.240
And then another number 11.

01:12.280 --> 01:19.280
Now I'm going to talk a lot more about functions and inputs and outputs in a couple of videos for now

01:19.520 --> 01:19.720
okay.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.040
But let's see what this returns again.

01:22.240 --> 01:27.080
Initially this just gives us back a range object, which is literally what I typed in here.

01:27.400 --> 01:32.920
So, uh, until you know how to work with these range objects, this does not seem very useful.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.600
So now let's convert this into a list.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.240
And now we get numbers that start from five.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.440
So this is an inclusive lower bound.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.200
And then they go up to ten.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.720
So again exclusive upper bound.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.920
As I mentioned in the previous video it's weird.

01:50.920 --> 01:52.440
It's hard to understand.

01:52.440 --> 01:58.360
But uh, once you get once you work with Python a little bit more, I promise this stuff will start

01:58.360 --> 01:59.360
to feel natural.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.200
Okay, I said, we're going to call this vector y.

02:03.240 --> 02:04.320
This variable y.

02:04.800 --> 02:05.080
Okay.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.200
So now we have y.

02:06.240 --> 02:10.320
It's a list and it's the numbers five through ten.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.640
So those integers.

02:12.160 --> 02:12.440
Okay.

02:12.480 --> 02:16.440
So you already know how to access individual elements in this list.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.080
Let me print this out.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.600
So we always have this for visual reference.

02:21.160 --> 02:21.520
Okay.

02:21.560 --> 02:27.440
So what I'm going to show you now is how to get multiple elements out of this list.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.240
There's several ways to do this.

02:29.240 --> 02:34.920
One way I'm going to show you now is by writing zero colon two.

02:35.440 --> 02:35.760
Okay.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.560
So I have this list here.

02:37.880 --> 02:42.320
And I'm using the square brackets the same way we use for indexing.

02:42.480 --> 02:46.240
But now I'm providing three characters in here.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.320
So zero and then a colon and then two.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.800
And let's see what this gives us.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.720
So this gives us the numbers five and six.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.240
And what do these correspond to.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.920
Well those are the first two elements.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.800
So I think you're starting to see a pattern.

03:00.800 --> 03:01.240
Here.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.360
We have the lower bound which is inclusive.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.520
That's this number here.

03:05.800 --> 03:09.040
And then we have the upper bound which is exclusive.

03:09.560 --> 03:17.250
And why is this exclusive because this is index zero, index one and index two, but we don't actually

03:17.250 --> 03:21.650
get the seven out of here because this is an exclusive upper bound.

03:22.090 --> 03:28.810
So even though there are actually three integers between 0 and 2, including zero and two, right,

03:28.850 --> 03:33.370
zero, one, two, we only get out the first two elements.

03:33.730 --> 03:41.250
Okay, so now it turns out if you want to index or slice starting from the beginning of a list or a

03:41.250 --> 03:45.690
vector, you can actually just leave the zero out.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.930
So this will also give us five six.

03:48.930 --> 03:53.010
And implicitly Python understands that there's a zero in here.

03:53.650 --> 03:53.970
Okay.

03:54.010 --> 03:56.930
So now yeah we can keep playing around with this.

03:57.290 --> 04:03.410
And here we get the elements from zero up until index four.

04:03.570 --> 04:08.490
So this is index 01234.

04:09.010 --> 04:12.330
So the index four is the number nine.

04:13.090 --> 04:20.130
But this is an exclusive upper bound, so Python only returns up to the number eight.

04:20.610 --> 04:23.650
And we can also do this starting at let's say index two.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.970
So here we have index zero index one.

04:27.130 --> 04:29.650
Index two is the number seven.

04:29.930 --> 04:33.570
And then we go you know we specify this upper bound is four.

04:33.850 --> 04:36.730
But that is an exclusive upper bound.

04:36.730 --> 04:39.130
So we only get up to eight.

04:40.570 --> 04:45.850
Now previously I showed you that you can leave out the first number.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.890
And Python assumes you mean zero.

04:48.250 --> 04:54.930
Similarly we can leave out the last number, and Python assumes that you want to go up until the end.

04:55.250 --> 05:00.730
So two colon is going to give us all of the elements in the list.

05:00.730 --> 05:04.450
So all the list items starting from 012.

05:04.490 --> 05:10.450
So starting at seven all the way up to the end however long this is okay.

05:10.490 --> 05:13.090
And then we can also start to mix and match some stuff.

05:13.090 --> 05:20.970
So let's say we know we want to start indexing or slicing at the at the third index.

05:20.970 --> 05:23.050
So index position two.

05:23.570 --> 05:26.130
And then we don't know exactly where we want to end.

05:26.490 --> 05:29.450
But we know that it's got to be two from the end okay.

05:29.490 --> 05:31.530
So we can do something like this.

05:31.770 --> 05:33.930
So this is minus one.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.690
And this index here is minus two.

05:37.530 --> 05:45.570
And then because this is exclusive upper bound Python is going to return seven eight okay I hope that

05:45.570 --> 05:46.450
makes sense.

05:46.610 --> 05:52.050
Slicing and indexing is a little bit weird to wrap your head around at first, but I hope you're starting

05:52.050 --> 05:53.170
to see the patterns.

05:54.130 --> 05:55.690
Okay, I am going to.

05:55.730 --> 05:56.090
Let's see.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.810
I want to make this a little bit longer.

05:57.810 --> 06:01.370
So now I'm just extending this list to go from 5 to 15.

06:01.770 --> 06:06.130
Now what I'm going to ask for is still from index three.

06:06.170 --> 06:06.450
Actually.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.930
Maybe I'll make this from the second index.

06:08.930 --> 06:13.450
So index location one up until the n minus two.

06:13.450 --> 06:16.930
And now I'm going to put in another colon in here.

06:17.170 --> 06:18.650
And that is going to go here.

06:18.650 --> 06:21.810
So now I have the syntax one.

06:21.810 --> 06:23.570
Colon minus two.

06:24.090 --> 06:25.610
Colon two.

06:25.730 --> 06:26.890
And what does this mean?

06:27.010 --> 06:32.010
So the way to think about this in your head is grouping them together like this.

06:32.010 --> 06:36.970
The spacing is a little ridiculous here but we are grouping together these two.

06:37.010 --> 06:39.690
So before and after the first colon.

06:39.890 --> 06:43.650
And then separately grouping together this colon over here.

06:43.850 --> 06:44.130
Okay.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.250
So what does this mean.

06:45.290 --> 06:50.130
This still gives us from index one to index minus two.

06:51.010 --> 06:55.250
But here this means that we want to skip by two.

06:55.290 --> 07:02.370
So instead of Python returning every single element between 1 and -2, it's going to give us every other

07:02.370 --> 07:03.090
element.

07:03.970 --> 07:07.850
So we start at index one which is here.

07:08.130 --> 07:10.410
And then it's going to skip by two.

07:10.650 --> 07:12.130
So we're not going to get this one.

07:12.130 --> 07:13.450
We are going to get this one.

07:13.450 --> 07:14.810
We're not going to get the nine.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.690
We are going to get the ten and so on.

07:16.690 --> 07:22.650
We're skipping this up until we get to whatever number is as high as we can get to.

07:22.690 --> 07:29.300
So the largest index we can get to that is still below this exclusive upper bound.

07:29.620 --> 07:35.700
So this exclusive upper bound, if we were to set this back to one, you can see this goes up to 13.

07:36.140 --> 07:40.180
So that gives us up to 13 because this is position minus one.

07:40.180 --> 07:41.620
Position minus two.

07:41.900 --> 07:43.420
So that gives us up to here.

07:43.420 --> 07:51.500
But when we skip by two then we cannot actually get up here because this is the last element.

07:51.500 --> 07:59.020
And Python is not going to give us 14 because that is that violates this request over here to have the

07:59.060 --> 08:00.100
end minus two.

08:00.660 --> 08:01.380
Very good.

08:01.460 --> 08:07.700
Uh, two more things I want to show you here, which is making variables.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.060
So let's say start equals.

08:10.060 --> 08:13.980
How about one and stop equals nine.

08:14.260 --> 08:18.140
And then let's say uh skip equals two.

08:18.180 --> 08:18.500
Okay.

08:18.540 --> 08:26.460
So now I'm going to write here start to stop in skip exactly what I just did before.

08:26.540 --> 08:31.380
Well not exactly exactly because I'm using the same numbers, but exactly the same principle.

08:31.580 --> 08:39.100
Except now I'm using variables here instead of writing the numbers directly into the in between the

08:39.100 --> 08:40.260
square brackets here.

08:40.700 --> 08:40.980
Okay.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.660
And then yeah that works.

08:42.900 --> 08:48.900
The last thing I want to show you here is how to reverse order a list.

08:49.340 --> 08:53.980
So to reverse the order of a list you write out the whole list.

08:53.980 --> 08:58.980
So now you know this is going from implicitly it's from zero to the end.

08:59.380 --> 09:02.260
But we can just leave the those numbers out.

09:02.540 --> 09:05.620
So this is giving me well this is skipping by two.

09:05.660 --> 09:05.980
Let's see.

09:06.020 --> 09:07.380
Here's the regular list.

09:08.380 --> 09:14.580
And now if we want to reverse the order of the list we can skip by minus one.

09:14.940 --> 09:15.980
Pretty neat concept.

09:15.980 --> 09:21.820
So we are skipping by minus one, which means we start at the end and we go backwards.

09:21.860 --> 09:24.860
Of course you can also skip by minus two and so on.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.500
This is going to start at the end.

09:26.660 --> 09:29.860
Go to the beginning skipping in steps of two.
