00:02.080 --> 00:09.840
In this and the next several videos, you are going to learn how to display and work with and filter

00:09.840 --> 00:11.480
text information.

00:11.840 --> 00:18.840
Obviously this is a course on language modeling, so we are going to be working a lot with text data.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.080
So let's begin.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.200
I'm actually going to begin with something you already know how to do.

00:23.200 --> 00:30.280
So let's say I'm just going to create a number equals sign there and a string I'll use S and g here.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.920
And let's call this cellar doors.

00:33.920 --> 00:36.520
Uh maybe correct spelling in here okay.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.080
Like that cellar doors.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.640
And we have a string of 45.3.

00:40.680 --> 00:41.040
Okay.

00:41.080 --> 00:51.920
So if I want to print out some mixed information and let's say I would like to have, uh, str num space

00:51.960 --> 00:54.000
plus s g.

00:54.040 --> 00:54.360
Okay.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.960
So this you already know how to do.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.920
I'm missing a plus sign over here.

00:58.920 --> 00:59.790
Hear this.

00:59.790 --> 01:00.710
You already know how to do.

01:00.710 --> 01:04.830
I would like to have 45.3 cellar doors for whatever reason.

01:05.550 --> 01:08.670
Here we are concatenating using the plus sign.

01:08.870 --> 01:15.990
Here is a number, but I have to convert it into a string to get it to work to get it to display.

01:16.310 --> 01:20.270
This variable is already a string, so I still need the plus sign.

01:20.470 --> 01:21.790
Here I have a space.

01:21.830 --> 01:24.590
Okay, so this is kind of clunky.

01:24.630 --> 01:26.750
It's really easy to make mistakes.

01:26.750 --> 01:29.550
As you saw I just made a mistake okay.

01:29.590 --> 01:39.150
So the idea is to use two different methods in or syntax approaches in Python to make this same output,

01:39.150 --> 01:41.670
but get it to be easier to write out.

01:41.670 --> 01:46.390
So the first method that I will show you is called string interpolation.

01:46.670 --> 01:49.350
And what I'm going to do here is write.

01:49.350 --> 01:51.670
I would like to have.

01:51.990 --> 01:55.950
And then this is going to look strange at first, but I will explain it in a moment.

01:56.310 --> 02:04.460
So percent g percent s and then a percent sign and then num comma s and g.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.340
So this runs.

02:06.340 --> 02:09.620
It gives us the exact same output that we have over here.

02:09.900 --> 02:12.140
But you can see it's a lot cleaner right.

02:12.180 --> 02:14.780
The whole code just looks a lot nicer.

02:14.780 --> 02:16.420
We don't need all these plus signs.

02:16.420 --> 02:19.020
We don't have to worry about extra spaces and so on.

02:20.180 --> 02:27.780
Okay, so the idea is that when we write this string here and then we have a percent and then a certain

02:27.780 --> 02:33.820
key letter either G or S, there's a couple of other options, but mostly you'll be using G and s.

02:34.460 --> 02:41.900
And then we have another percent sign with a tuple out here after the quote ends.

02:42.460 --> 02:50.140
So the idea is that we have two pieces of information that we want to fill in or substitute.

02:50.140 --> 02:52.180
Python calls it interpolate.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.580
I think it would be better if we call this method substitution.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.480
But anyway, It doesn't matter.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.680
And then there are two elements over here.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.600
Two variables.

03:01.760 --> 03:07.520
So this one gets mapped onto this, and this one gets replaced with whatever is in here.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.080
And what is the g and the s for.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.920
So the g is for a number and the s is for a string.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.360
So if I would write g g.

03:17.600 --> 03:24.280
Now I get an error message because Python is expecting to replace this with a number.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.120
But actually this is of type string.

03:27.680 --> 03:28.040
Okay.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.000
So that needs to be a G.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.200
Now what do you think is going to happen if I replace this with an S.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.280
It turns out that that works.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.840
So sometimes it's a little bit more flexible.

03:38.160 --> 03:38.520
Okay.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.400
And then yeah you can also do math inside here.

03:42.800 --> 03:43.080
Okay.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.680
So this is for string interpolation.

03:46.080 --> 03:54.480
Uh sometimes depending on the application I use string interpolation uh, when I'm coding it with mixing

03:54.480 --> 03:58.350
in Python and strings and SymPy and latex coating.

03:58.670 --> 04:01.670
Then I use string interpolation a lot.

04:01.710 --> 04:07.630
Most of the time, but in this course I'm mostly going to be using what's called f strings.

04:08.070 --> 04:15.790
F strings are even more flexible to work with and display information compared to string interpolation,

04:15.990 --> 04:18.910
and f strings work most of the time.

04:19.070 --> 04:28.190
There are situations where you are mixing LaTeX with Python code, and then f strings can be really

04:28.230 --> 04:29.350
a major headache.

04:29.550 --> 04:33.790
So then it's better to use string interpolation, but I don't.

04:33.790 --> 04:35.710
You don't need to worry about that for this course.

04:35.710 --> 04:39.790
For this course, I just want you to know about string interpolation.

04:39.790 --> 04:42.630
But mostly we're going to be using f strings.

04:43.030 --> 04:43.350
Okay.

04:43.390 --> 04:45.110
So how does f strings work.

04:45.270 --> 04:53.110
Now I'm going to print I would like to have and then curly brackets num and then another curly bracket

04:53.430 --> 04:54.740
S and G.

04:55.220 --> 04:55.740
Okay.

04:55.780 --> 04:56.180
Oops.

04:56.700 --> 04:57.140
Okay.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.940
So actually, this is pretty interesting.

04:58.940 --> 05:03.380
This is a mistake on my part, but this is a nice teaching moment.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.900
So here I have curly brackets.

05:05.940 --> 05:07.580
So notice they're curly brackets.

05:07.580 --> 05:10.900
They're not parentheses and they are not square brackets.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.580
So curly brackets.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.940
And then the variable name inside.

05:14.980 --> 05:22.580
Now if I just print out this message the way I have it written here, Python literally interprets all

05:22.580 --> 05:23.700
of this text.

05:23.740 --> 05:32.100
What we need to do to make this be an f string is include an f, and you put the f immediately before

05:32.100 --> 05:37.020
the quote over here, so f and then immediately a quote with no spaces.

05:37.140 --> 05:41.180
And now you can also see that these colors have changed.

05:41.180 --> 05:48.740
So notice now I remove the f and we have all of the text is this kind of reddish color.

05:49.060 --> 05:52.420
And now when I include the f then the brackets turn green.

05:52.570 --> 05:54.770
And the variable names turn black.

05:55.050 --> 05:55.490
Okay.

05:55.530 --> 06:01.210
And now we get the result that I was looking for which matches what we have up here.

06:01.810 --> 06:04.410
Next example of f strings.

06:04.410 --> 06:06.210
Let's do something in a for loop.

06:06.210 --> 06:11.050
So for I in range nine to how about 18.

06:11.050 --> 06:12.330
Let's do something like this.

06:12.650 --> 06:14.170
And now I will write print.

06:14.650 --> 06:24.530
Uh I is a number and I to the power of four is a bigger number.

06:24.530 --> 06:26.970
That is a factually true statement.

06:27.330 --> 06:27.690
Okay.

06:27.730 --> 06:30.090
So here I see nine is a number.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.130
And yeah these are bigger numbers.

06:32.170 --> 06:37.290
Now what if I wanted to do let's say I divided by three.

06:37.410 --> 06:40.890
So it's I three to the power of four.

06:41.410 --> 06:46.330
Now this is all accurate but it's starting to look ugly right.

06:46.370 --> 06:49.610
Because look how the spacing gets mixed up here.

06:49.690 --> 06:57.640
So in particular this has a lot of numbers after the decimal point, and this only has few numbers or

06:57.640 --> 06:59.600
one number after the decimal point.

06:59.600 --> 07:06.400
So what we can do very easily with f strings is control the formatting of the output.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.920
In fact, that's what the F stands for.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.000
It stands for formatting okay.

07:10.040 --> 07:15.760
So to control this I'm going to use a colon after the calculation.

07:16.040 --> 07:16.280
Right.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.400
So the colon comes after the number.

07:18.400 --> 07:23.400
It doesn't come before it doesn't come in the middle it goes after.

07:23.400 --> 07:28.040
And now I'm going to write decimal two f point two f.

07:28.440 --> 07:35.160
And now notice that every single number here has exactly two decimal points or two numbers after the

07:35.160 --> 07:36.040
decimal point.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.320
And if I do this with five, then we get five.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.160
If I do it with zero, then I get zero.

07:41.200 --> 07:41.440
Okay.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.960
So let's set this back to two.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.320
And now that's fine.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.720
We see there's a little still a little bit of a shift here.

07:47.720 --> 07:54.700
And that actually happens Bins over here because all of the numbers after nine have two digits, but

07:54.700 --> 07:57.420
the number nine only has one digit.

07:57.420 --> 07:59.700
So I'm going to write colon two.

08:00.060 --> 08:08.060
And now there's no period in here because I don't you know I can also include a period oops needs an

08:08.060 --> 08:08.700
F in there.

08:08.940 --> 08:10.780
I can also include a period.

08:10.780 --> 08:14.460
But these are integers so I don't care about that okay.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.420
So the two here needs to be like this.

08:17.620 --> 08:27.100
The two here is specifying the formatting that I want to have two characters for this information to

08:27.140 --> 08:27.860
be displayed.

08:27.860 --> 08:30.100
So for example, if I would make this four.

08:30.460 --> 08:33.700
Now you can see there's some extra spaces in the beginning.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.340
There's some trailing spaces.

08:35.740 --> 08:40.100
This could be useful if we're counting up into the hundreds or into the thousands.

08:40.380 --> 08:44.220
Okay, so I will set this back to two and let's see what else we have.

08:44.260 --> 08:44.460
Okay.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.620
We have a similar problem over here.

08:46.900 --> 08:50.130
So this bothers me I don't think it looks very nice.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.650
So what I want to do is have.

08:52.690 --> 08:53.210
Let's see.

08:53.210 --> 08:57.170
Well, we're going up to the thousands, so that means four over here.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.170
So here I will write 4.2.

09:00.770 --> 09:01.410
And.

09:01.610 --> 09:02.090
Huh.

09:02.370 --> 09:03.490
It still doesn't work.

09:03.490 --> 09:04.930
What do you think the problem is?

09:06.090 --> 09:13.650
The problem here is that four is actually fewer numbers than we already need to represent these numbers.

09:13.810 --> 09:19.330
So here I have 123 including the decimal .45.

09:19.330 --> 09:21.130
So this already has five.

09:21.570 --> 09:25.130
So let's do uh how about six okay.

09:25.170 --> 09:33.730
So if I say uh minimum six spaces then that looks good for this number which is less than 100, but

09:33.730 --> 09:37.530
it's still misaligned with the thousands because here we have seven.

09:37.930 --> 09:38.130
Right.

09:38.170 --> 09:41.930
So you can see there's four numbers over here two numbers over here.

09:41.930 --> 09:43.090
And then the decimal point.

09:43.090 --> 09:44.330
So that makes seven.
