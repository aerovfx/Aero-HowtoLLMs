00:02.440 --> 00:10.920
In this video, I will introduce you to processing text that you have and in particular extracting words

00:11.080 --> 00:12.800
from sentences.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.360
So let me start with a sentence.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.640
So let's say here is a sentence.

00:18.640 --> 00:24.160
And this is going to be words in a sentence are separated by spaces.

00:24.280 --> 00:24.560
Okay.

00:24.600 --> 00:25.360
Very nice.

00:25.640 --> 00:32.720
So now if I were to just print out the sentence we get just one long string like this.

00:32.880 --> 00:36.960
I can calculate the length and there's 44 characters.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.200
Now here's the thing.

00:38.360 --> 00:43.320
When you read this text, you know that these are separate words.

00:43.320 --> 00:50.320
So you look at this text and you see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight words.

00:50.440 --> 00:53.200
But Python does not see eight words.

00:53.320 --> 00:57.200
Python just sees 44 characters put together.

00:57.680 --> 01:04.680
So we need a way to break up this sentence into the individual words.

01:04.820 --> 01:06.060
So how do we do that?

01:06.100 --> 01:06.540
Okay.

01:06.780 --> 01:10.900
So to do that we can apply a method on sentence.

01:11.060 --> 01:12.700
And it's called split.

01:13.100 --> 01:17.220
So I am going to split according to spaces.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.940
The output of this method.

01:19.940 --> 01:26.180
Remember a method is like a function acting on a single variable is a list.

01:26.180 --> 01:27.660
You can see the square brackets.

01:27.660 --> 01:34.740
So this is a list, and all of the elements in the list correspond to all of the words in the sentence.

01:34.740 --> 01:41.020
And now there's no spaces because the spaces were dropped because that's what is used to split.

01:41.420 --> 01:45.420
So that's an example for a space we can also split by ease.

01:45.420 --> 01:50.940
So words in a are you know here we do have a space in here.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.940
And here's another space okay.

01:52.980 --> 01:59.580
So now this is splitting up according to spaces mostly you will just be splitting by spaces.

01:59.740 --> 02:06.380
Sometimes you know if you're processing a CSV file a comma separated values file, you might separate

02:06.380 --> 02:08.060
according to commas.

02:08.060 --> 02:15.800
In this case, there are no commas here, so Python recognizes the entire text as just one element in

02:15.800 --> 02:16.880
this list.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.400
Okay, let me go back to spaces here.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.320
So now I'm going to write words equals.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.360
And basically I'm just putting this into a variable.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.720
And with that I can use a for loop.

02:27.720 --> 02:35.320
And what I want to do with this for loop is print out each word and count the number of letters in that

02:35.360 --> 02:36.000
word.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.000
So for w in words.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.040
And now this is the iterator variable.

02:42.040 --> 02:49.680
And this is the variable that I'm using in the for loop to iterate over all the elements in this list.

02:50.120 --> 02:50.440
Okay.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.440
So I will write with an f string.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.440
There are something something letters.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.600
Actually I'll write this as characters in the word.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.040
Like this.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.440
Okay, great.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.480
So now I need to fill in these.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.640
So how many characters are in each word.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.700
Well we can do this with the Len function.

03:13.940 --> 03:16.580
And then here I just want to print out the entire word.

03:16.980 --> 03:17.380
Okay.

03:17.420 --> 03:18.700
And word is not defined.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.100
Oh yeah.

03:19.100 --> 03:19.460
Sorry.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.540
It's a w not word.

03:21.780 --> 03:22.420
Okay great.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.420
There are five characters in the word.

03:24.420 --> 03:27.860
Words in a sentence are separated by spaces.

03:27.900 --> 03:28.620
Very nice.

03:29.380 --> 03:34.820
There is another library that I will introduce you to here and that is called string.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.740
So import string.

03:36.980 --> 03:39.460
This is a fairly small library.

03:39.460 --> 03:43.260
It's not like numpy or matplotlib or PyTorch.

03:43.260 --> 03:44.980
These are huge libraries.

03:45.180 --> 03:51.940
String is a rather small library, and there's not so much that we will need to do with it, but it

03:51.940 --> 03:52.900
is quite useful.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.220
So let's write string.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.500
Again this is going to tell us a.

03:57.580 --> 04:04.900
It's going to give us a list of all of the methods and attributes that are contained inside this library

04:05.060 --> 04:05.740
string.

04:05.940 --> 04:07.860
So you can see there's really not that many.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.860
And let's start exploring some of these.

04:10.300 --> 04:16.250
So we have string dot Ascii lowercase Okay.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.010
And this is just a string.

04:19.050 --> 04:23.490
And each element of the string is all the letters of the alphabet in lowercase.

04:23.730 --> 04:27.170
I bet you have no idea what uppercase is going to be.

04:27.490 --> 04:28.050
Just kidding.

04:28.090 --> 04:28.330
Okay.

04:28.370 --> 04:32.210
Of course, you know, it's all the letters of the alphabet, but now they are uppercase.

04:32.530 --> 04:33.770
Let's see, what else do we have?

04:33.770 --> 04:34.490
Digits.

04:35.330 --> 04:36.490
That is pretty useful.

04:36.490 --> 04:37.610
Zero through nine.

04:37.810 --> 04:44.770
These are the kinds of handy tools that you can use for identifying information in strings.

04:44.770 --> 04:49.690
So for example let's say I have a string and it is the string four.

04:49.730 --> 04:54.050
And now I can say s in str digits.

04:54.050 --> 05:00.530
And the answer here is true because this string four is in this set over here.

05:00.650 --> 05:02.610
And now maybe I can do the letter E.

05:02.650 --> 05:11.930
And now the answer is false because e is not in the digits but it is in the Ascii lowercase.

05:11.930 --> 05:13.770
So now the answer will be true.

05:14.210 --> 05:16.890
And here's something interesting I can do e.

05:17.170 --> 05:18.410
So uppercase e.

05:18.690 --> 05:20.710
And now the answer is false.

05:20.950 --> 05:26.070
But if we don't care about case, then you can use s dot lower.

05:26.070 --> 05:27.390
And that gives us true.

05:27.710 --> 05:31.950
And then there's also a string dot Ascii like this.

05:32.110 --> 05:32.550
Uh wait.

05:32.550 --> 05:36.150
It's called Ascii letters sorry Ascii letters.

05:36.150 --> 05:40.750
And that is all the lowercase and all the uppercase letters.

05:41.550 --> 05:46.590
We also have string dot punctuation.

05:47.270 --> 05:50.310
And that gives us a list of all the punctuation marks.

05:50.310 --> 05:53.590
That's also pretty useful for text processing.

05:53.790 --> 05:57.110
And let's see we also have string dot whitespace.

05:57.830 --> 06:04.110
And that gives you all of the special characters that are interpreted as whitespace.

06:04.110 --> 06:07.030
So this is just a regular space.

06:07.390 --> 06:11.030
Slash T is for tab slash n is for newline.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.270
Slash r is for carriage return.

06:13.270 --> 06:19.270
And I have to admit I do not know what these two stand for, but obviously there are some kind of whitespace

06:19.270 --> 06:22.550
indicators I'm sure you could figure out with a quick Google search.
