WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:08.400
In Python, it is possible to import text directly from a website.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.520
And that's what I'm going to show you how to do in this video.

00:12.920 --> 00:18.720
So to import text from a website, we need to use a library that is called requests.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.040
So import requests.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.080
And now yeah if you want you can do something like this.

00:24.080 --> 00:28.240
But most people just refer to this library by the full name.

00:28.440 --> 00:29.720
So import requests.

00:29.720 --> 00:33.120
And now I specify a URL and let's see.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.680
So here is a URL that I found.

00:35.840 --> 00:41.760
It is from the Gutenberg Press website which is a fantastic website.

00:41.760 --> 00:50.160
It's a real gem of humanity that they have lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of books, all freely

00:50.160 --> 00:51.400
available online.

00:51.440 --> 00:55.080
Okay, let me do 1727 dot txt.

00:55.560 --> 00:58.480
Okay, so let me show you what this website looks like.

00:59.520 --> 00:59.760
Okay.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.320
There's a little typo in the URL.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.560
I'll show you that when I switch back to Python.

01:03.720 --> 01:07.610
Okay this is the Project Gutenberg and this is the Odyssey.

01:07.810 --> 01:11.290
So by Homer, this is so we can scroll down.

01:11.330 --> 01:16.730
This is just text and it is the entirety of the Odyssey by Homer.

01:16.730 --> 01:18.170
So that's really fantastic.

01:18.210 --> 01:23.690
You can just read the whole thing, you can download it, you can search for, you know, how often

01:23.690 --> 01:25.850
does the word of appear in here?

01:25.890 --> 01:26.970
Lots of times.

01:27.490 --> 01:34.450
Uh, if you are not familiar with this website, gutenberg.org, then I highly recommend going to that

01:34.450 --> 01:41.010
website after this video and just browsing around and seeing what is available on that website.

01:41.530 --> 01:46.250
Nonetheless, I will use this website here just to download information.

01:46.250 --> 01:50.210
And this is the this is the typo I made before.

01:50.490 --> 01:50.810
Okay.

01:50.850 --> 01:52.690
So this is a string variable.

01:52.690 --> 01:54.330
This is not the website yet.

01:54.530 --> 01:59.650
Now I'm going to write the Odyssey equals request dot.

01:59.650 --> 02:00.650
Get up.

02:01.330 --> 02:01.650
Okay.

02:01.690 --> 02:08.090
So now this is going to go online and get all the information at this URL.

02:08.250 --> 02:13.070
Download it and put it into this variable here called Odyssey.

02:13.310 --> 02:18.470
So this is a particular type of variable Odyssey.

02:19.150 --> 02:22.390
And it is of type request models.

02:22.630 --> 02:23.830
So what can we do with this.

02:23.870 --> 02:31.630
So if you have a class variable an object an instance of a class, and you want to know what are the

02:31.790 --> 02:34.350
methods and attributes you can type dir.

02:34.390 --> 02:39.750
Dir for directory and then in parentheses the name of the variable.

02:39.870 --> 02:46.030
This gives you all the information about the methods that you can apply to this.

02:46.190 --> 02:49.790
Now there's a lot of methods on this object.

02:49.790 --> 02:55.350
And basically the only thing that we want is dot txt here.

02:55.590 --> 03:01.270
So I will write odyssey dot text like this.

03:02.550 --> 03:02.910
Okay.

03:02.950 --> 03:07.110
And this is actually the entire text of that website.

03:07.350 --> 03:11.510
Now it looks funny because there's some formatting codes in here.

03:11.950 --> 03:17.960
Dash n is for newline r r r is for character return and so on.

03:18.240 --> 03:25.880
So I can encase this in print and let's only print maybe the first 2000 characters.

03:26.240 --> 03:32.800
Okay, so here we have the contents of that website, which for this particular example is this book,

03:32.840 --> 03:33.640
The Odyssey.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.160
Let's export this.

03:36.200 --> 03:40.640
I will write actually I'll do this in a separate cell here.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.400
So web text equals odyssey dot text.

03:44.400 --> 03:48.480
And now I just want to know how long is this web text.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.000
So this is 70,000 characters.

03:52.000 --> 04:00.120
So there's 70,000 not just letters and numbers but also formatting characters like slash n r and so

04:00.120 --> 04:00.440
on.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.720
So 70,000.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.360
And we might ask how many are unique?

04:05.360 --> 04:09.240
How many unique characters are in this web text?

04:09.480 --> 04:17.800
One of the ways to measure to find all the unique elements in a list is to use the function set.

04:17.920 --> 04:21.930
So set is going to create a mathematical set.

04:21.930 --> 04:28.210
And if you're unfamiliar with the concept of a mathematical set like from set theory, then it essentially

04:28.210 --> 04:33.290
contains a list of all the unique elements in the list.

04:33.450 --> 04:40.410
So here we see these are all of the unique characters in web text, some Greek characters in here,

04:40.610 --> 04:46.770
it's going to be some punctuation marks, some formatting marks and all of the letters.

04:46.970 --> 04:47.850
So let's see.

04:48.170 --> 04:51.010
We can type Len of set.

04:51.210 --> 04:57.250
And so this is pretty interesting already an interesting feature about language that I'll talk a lot

04:57.250 --> 05:00.090
more about with tokenization and embedding.

05:00.370 --> 05:06.370
But essentially this text has 700,000 characters in total.

05:06.370 --> 05:10.290
And yet only 150 of them are actually unique.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.770
Let's write this out using an F string.

05:12.970 --> 05:14.330
So I will write print.

05:14.890 --> 05:15.770
There are.

05:16.010 --> 05:21.130
And then I'm just going to leave this as an empty curly bracket for now, and then fill it in later.

05:21.450 --> 05:31.070
So there are something total characters in the text, blank of which are well, let me do it like this.

05:31.070 --> 05:32.110
And blank.

05:32.150 --> 05:34.510
Unique characters.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.470
Okay, so now what do we want?

05:36.510 --> 05:43.270
We want an F string and we want to know the total which is the length of the web text.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.910
And then we want to know how many unique characters there are.

05:49.950 --> 05:50.550
Great.

05:50.710 --> 05:51.950
And so that looks like this.

05:51.950 --> 05:53.790
Now this is a big number.

05:54.030 --> 06:02.710
Uh, in uh, in in English it's common to put a comma every three numbers just to help people read it.

06:02.710 --> 06:05.830
So it's a way to format that is a colon.

06:06.070 --> 06:09.670
And now in the previous video I talked about using periods.

06:09.790 --> 06:11.470
But in this case we don't want a period.

06:11.470 --> 06:12.990
We want a comma.

06:12.990 --> 06:14.270
So just a comma.

06:14.310 --> 06:18.630
You don't need to include an F after that or any numbers any digits.

06:19.470 --> 06:29.750
So now this says there are 710,323 total characters in the text and 149 unique characters.
