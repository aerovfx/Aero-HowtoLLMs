00:02.160 --> 00:10.000
In this and the next video, I will introduce you to objects to classes and object oriented programming.

00:10.560 --> 00:17.200
Now, object oriented programming and classes are not unique or specific to the PyTorch library.

00:17.560 --> 00:22.240
But if you work in PyTorch, you are going to be using classes quite a lot.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.560
So therefore, I decided to include these two videos in this PyTorch section.

00:27.800 --> 00:35.720
Anyway, what I want to do before coding is introduce you to two terms that will come up very often

00:35.720 --> 00:39.880
in when working with classes and instances of classes.

00:40.240 --> 00:44.080
So one is attribute and the other is method.

00:44.200 --> 00:48.400
Now an attribute is basically like a variable.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.680
And a method is basically like a function.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.720
These are not formal definitions.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.600
It's not exactly this equivalence.

00:56.760 --> 01:03.640
But this is what I would like you to keep in mind when you are working with and creating classes and

01:03.640 --> 01:04.480
instances.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.960
So instances of classes have attributes.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.560
Those are kind of like variables.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.160
And they also have methods.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.200
And those are kind of like functions.

01:13.520 --> 01:13.960
Okay.

01:14.040 --> 01:21.280
So it turns out that you have been working with classes and instances objects all throughout this Python

01:21.280 --> 01:21.880
tutorial.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.680
So far I just haven't been using those terms.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.240
So one example is a list.

01:28.240 --> 01:32.040
So you are already familiar with a list.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.880
We have created and worked with many lists so far.

01:36.600 --> 01:41.760
And so it turns out that a list is actually a class in Python.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.240
So when I type L equals list and in this case I'm just inputting also list.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.080
So it's actually a little bit redundant.

01:49.080 --> 01:55.920
But it just highlights the idea that I will illustrate later about creating classes.

01:56.520 --> 02:03.680
So when we create an instance of this list this is giving us an object that has a lot of properties.

02:03.680 --> 02:09.240
So attributes and methods from this particular class called list.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.040
Okay.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.280
So now we can write dir.

02:12.320 --> 02:17.720
Dir for directory comes from directory from Linux terminology L.

02:17.720 --> 02:25.240
And this is going to give us a list of all of the properties of this instance.

02:25.240 --> 02:33.960
So all of the attributes and methods of this instance and some of these I already introduced you to

02:34.000 --> 02:36.880
like append and uh, count.

02:36.880 --> 02:41.920
I think I'd also used and some of these other ones I haven't yet uh, introduced you to.

02:42.280 --> 02:42.640
Okay.

02:42.680 --> 02:50.960
So how to access these properties of objects that you have also already seen before and use the dot

02:50.960 --> 02:55.680
symbol, uh, the, the period after the variable name.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.520
So l dot let's do reverse.

02:58.520 --> 02:59.200
Let me do this.

02:59.200 --> 03:05.830
So print L and then L dot reverse and then I will print out L again.

03:06.390 --> 03:06.750
Okay.

03:06.790 --> 03:11.470
So now we have from this line here it prints out the list 123.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.670
And now I use a method.

03:13.950 --> 03:20.430
And you know that this is a method on an object, partly because of the period and also partly because

03:20.430 --> 03:21.990
of the parentheses.

03:21.990 --> 03:23.950
So it's a lot like a function.

03:24.270 --> 03:24.550
Okay.

03:24.590 --> 03:25.750
And what does this do.

03:25.790 --> 03:29.110
Obviously it reverses the order of the list.

03:29.110 --> 03:32.510
So then I print it out again and we get 321.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.030
And now I could reverse it again.

03:35.350 --> 03:36.550
And let me see.

03:36.630 --> 03:37.950
Uh this is what I wanted to do.

03:37.990 --> 03:43.990
Print L so now I reverse it again and it gets reversed.

03:43.990 --> 03:44.230
Okay.

03:44.270 --> 03:53.630
So I keep reversing it back and forth, but let's, uh, let me redefine it up here, and then we can

03:53.630 --> 03:59.830
see it goes forwards, and then I reverse it and then I reverse it again, which means it goes forward

03:59.830 --> 04:01.070
again from the beginning.

04:01.750 --> 04:02.150
Okay.

04:02.190 --> 04:04.790
There's another method called append.

04:05.590 --> 04:09.950
And let's append a 99 and that adds a 99 on it okay.

04:09.990 --> 04:14.230
So the idea is that we have an instance of a class.

04:14.470 --> 04:19.750
And then we can access properties of this instance using the period.

04:20.750 --> 04:21.950
And then we can apply.

04:21.950 --> 04:24.830
In this case I've shown you a few different methods.

04:24.830 --> 04:30.150
And methods are like functions that act upon the variable over here.

04:30.390 --> 04:32.550
And this particular one is called append.

04:32.550 --> 04:35.350
And I give it the input of 99.

04:35.350 --> 04:39.670
And then it appends the the element 99.

04:39.950 --> 04:40.310
Okay.

04:40.350 --> 04:47.110
So that is a very brief introduction to classes and methods and attributes.

04:47.470 --> 04:52.230
In the next video we are going to create our very own class.

04:52.390 --> 04:58.110
And I think that will really hit the point home about what classes are and how to work with them.
