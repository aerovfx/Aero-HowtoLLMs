No one is born knowing exactly how to code and knowing how to use all the functions in Python.

00:10.520 --> 00:14.920
It's something you learn over time as you keep coding more and more.

00:15.280 --> 00:20.640
And so that means that very often you will be struggling with a particular function.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.760
Maybe you're getting errors or warnings and you don't know what to do.

00:24.320 --> 00:30.400
Or maybe you know the goal that you're trying to achieve, but you don't know exactly what is the function

00:30.400 --> 00:33.960
to use that that you need for your specific situation.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.360
So basically you're going to need to get help.

00:36.480 --> 00:41.200
So how do you get help when you are figuring out how to code or learning how to code?

00:41.600 --> 00:45.560
There's multiple ways to get help from encoding.

00:45.560 --> 00:49.280
And in this video I'm going to show you several ways to get help.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.560
One way is to use the function called help.

00:52.720 --> 00:58.840
So you type help, and then you input the name of a function that you want to learn about.

00:58.880 --> 01:05.030
Again, help is a reserved keyword, you can see that it turned from black to this kind of orangish

01:05.030 --> 01:06.390
dark yellow color.

01:06.670 --> 01:07.030
Okay.

01:07.070 --> 01:08.270
So help.

01:08.270 --> 01:11.270
And then the name of the function you're interested in.

01:11.510 --> 01:14.830
And the output here is going to be what's called the docstring.

01:14.870 --> 01:15.790
I'll write this out.

01:15.830 --> 01:18.230
Docstring as one word.

01:18.430 --> 01:20.830
I don't know why they call this the docstring.

01:20.830 --> 01:25.150
In my opinion they should have called it the help text because that's what it's supposed to do.

01:26.190 --> 01:33.030
But anyway, the docstring is a little piece of text that many but not all, functions have at the beginning

01:33.030 --> 01:35.870
of the function definition.

01:35.870 --> 01:42.550
And it just gives you a little bit of guidance about the purpose of the function and how to use it,

01:42.590 --> 01:44.910
and what are the inputs and what are the outputs.

01:45.830 --> 01:51.030
Now, I have to say, I have mixed feelings about Python as a coding language.

01:51.150 --> 01:53.030
There are some things about it that I really like.

01:53.030 --> 01:58.790
Some things that I find a little bit unfortunate or suboptimal or could be improved.

01:59.350 --> 02:07.770
Uh, the doc strings in Python are not often written in a way that is very accessible to beginners.

02:08.010 --> 02:16.010
So if you are trying to read a docstring and you don't understand it, then do not get.

02:16.370 --> 02:21.050
You know, don't fall into a pit of despair and think that you're stupid and you'll never learn how

02:21.050 --> 02:21.690
to code.

02:21.890 --> 02:23.730
And you can't even read the docstrings.

02:24.090 --> 02:29.570
A much more likely scenario is that the docstrings were not written with you in mind.

02:30.250 --> 02:37.050
So I also very often struggle to understand the docstrings, and I've been coding for more years than

02:37.050 --> 02:38.170
I'm willing to admit.

02:39.330 --> 02:39.610
Okay.

02:39.650 --> 02:46.690
But nonetheless, getting help on a function using the function, the Python function help is a great

02:46.690 --> 02:53.010
way to get started, and it certainly is the case that many docstrings will be useful and will be helpful.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.570
Okay, that is one thing you can do.

02:55.610 --> 03:02.130
Another way to get help on a function is to write out the name of the function, and then two question

03:02.240 --> 03:03.360
marks afterwards.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.040
Like this.

03:04.320 --> 03:10.720
If you are using Google Colab, that's going to open up a separate little mini window here off to the

03:10.720 --> 03:11.280
right.

03:11.440 --> 03:18.120
And if you're using another notebook, you might see all of this text over here printed out in the output

03:18.120 --> 03:18.640
here.

03:18.760 --> 03:19.000
Okay.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.160
But this is a nice feature about Colab.

03:21.440 --> 03:29.480
Now in this particular case, this help file for this function only basically just repeats what the

03:29.640 --> 03:31.040
information is here.

03:32.160 --> 03:35.920
But there that's because this is a compiled function.

03:36.080 --> 03:40.160
And if it's a compiled function it means you don't actually see the Python code.

03:40.200 --> 03:46.680
Because this is not implemented in Python, it's implemented in C and it's compiled for speed.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.280
But there are other functions that you actually can view.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.520
For example we can look at numpy dot linspace.

03:53.520 --> 03:57.640
This is a function that I introduced you to in the previous video.

03:57.840 --> 04:00.000
So numpy dot linspace.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.160
And then question mark.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.000
Question mark.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.180
That's going to open up a new tab over here.

04:04.180 --> 04:05.940
So actually we get both of these here.

04:06.300 --> 04:09.100
And now this gives you a nice long docstring.

04:09.100 --> 04:13.900
It tells you a little bit more about each of the parameters or the inputs.

04:13.900 --> 04:17.940
So the start parameter the stop parameter the num parameter.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.300
This you've already seen before.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.740
There's even more parameters in here like the data type.

04:22.740 --> 04:28.460
So there's more ways to use the function linspace than the basic implementation that I showed.

04:28.740 --> 04:31.300
And then yeah here are the outputs and so on.

04:31.300 --> 04:37.140
This is other related functions that you might find interesting and relevant here.

04:37.140 --> 04:38.620
It shows you examples.

04:38.620 --> 04:39.660
This is fantastic.

04:39.660 --> 04:45.620
I can just copy and paste this in and and reproduce this example here.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.420
Uh graphical.

04:47.740 --> 04:54.460
So I haven't yet talked about visualizations, but this is also a way to visualize this is fantastic.

04:54.460 --> 05:01.220
And then here at the bottom we actually see the source code of numpy dot linspace.

05:01.380 --> 05:07.290
Now if you are new to Python, which you are, if you're watching this video, then all of this might

05:07.290 --> 05:10.170
look really intense and intimidating.

05:10.490 --> 05:17.210
But looking through source code is a fantastic way to understand how functions work, what they are

05:17.210 --> 05:20.210
doing, and to improve your coding skills.

05:20.530 --> 05:27.690
Now, maybe at this point you're not good enough in Python to look at source code and understand it,

05:27.690 --> 05:29.770
but you will very soon.

05:29.810 --> 05:35.570
You know, if you just code for several hours in Python, you will already be able to start looking

05:35.570 --> 05:41.610
through source code and really understand how these functions work and what they are implementing.

05:42.090 --> 05:46.530
Okay, so that is two ways to get help on functions.

05:47.410 --> 05:53.530
A third way to get help on a particular function is to look for it online.

05:53.770 --> 05:59.410
So I typed into this search browser how does numpy dot linspace work.

05:59.610 --> 06:03.290
Now the first result is from numpy website.

06:03.320 --> 06:09.760
but if we scroll down, we see some other websites and eventually, yeah, you're going to see lots

06:09.760 --> 06:15.080
of different explanations and tutorials for how this function works.

06:15.640 --> 06:20.680
So this is great when you have an error message or you're unsure how to use a function, just see what

06:20.720 --> 06:23.520
other people online have written about this function.

06:25.320 --> 06:33.320
Of course, another way to get help is to use a large language model like ChatGPT or Claude or Perplexity

06:33.320 --> 06:36.640
or any other language model.

06:37.080 --> 06:43.080
Okay, so here I'm writing in the prompt, I'm trying to create a numpy array of numbers that starts

06:43.080 --> 06:46.160
from -3.4 and ends at 52.

06:46.600 --> 06:51.720
And I don't know how long that array needs to be, so I need another variable that I can set for the

06:51.720 --> 06:53.280
number of elements.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.600
Can you help me with this.

06:55.040 --> 07:00.320
So notice this is different from how I got help in from searching online.

07:00.480 --> 07:05.180
When I was searching online, I was just searching for how to use a particular function.

07:05.700 --> 07:09.220
And here with ChatGPT I'm describing the problem.

07:09.220 --> 07:12.860
I'm describing the thing that the objective what I want to achieve.

07:13.140 --> 07:16.660
And I'm asking ChatGPT for help.

07:16.660 --> 07:23.860
And then let's see, I can even add here, uh, please write some code as a demo.

07:23.860 --> 07:28.140
Although I think ChatGPT would write code even if I didn't explicitly ask for this.

07:28.140 --> 07:36.380
But it's always good in ChatGPT to or other language models to provide some context and background that

07:36.380 --> 07:41.940
will help the language model figure out the best response that's tailored for your needs.

07:42.740 --> 07:49.700
So ChatGPT said we can accomplish this using Numpy's Linspace function and it provides some code.

07:49.700 --> 07:55.580
We can just click this button and immediately copy this code to paste it into a notebook.

07:55.780 --> 07:57.140
And this is fantastic.

07:57.140 --> 08:02.900
So this gives us the name of the function and also an explanation of how it works.
