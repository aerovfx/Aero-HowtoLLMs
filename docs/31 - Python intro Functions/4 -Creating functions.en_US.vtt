00:01.800 --> 00:03.920
Where do functions come from?

00:04.440 --> 00:09.600
They are not written into the texture of the universe at the moment of the Big Bang.

00:10.080 --> 00:13.440
Instead, functions are written by humans.

00:13.840 --> 00:21.320
Lots of functions are written by professional developers who have years or sometimes decades of experience

00:21.320 --> 00:25.800
with computer science and with developing libraries and functions.

00:25.800 --> 00:30.800
But lots and lots of functions are written by like normal people like you and me.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.720
And so in this video, I'm going to teach you how to create your own functions in Python.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.120
This is quite useful.

00:39.120 --> 00:44.760
You will write a lot of your own functions as you progress through Python.

00:45.240 --> 00:49.640
Okay, so let's start with a very simple example of a function.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.760
So I am going to write def def for define.

00:54.040 --> 00:59.840
You can see also again another example of a reserved keyword in Python.

01:00.080 --> 01:08.820
So here the text turns from black to blue and when I write def okay, so def and I'm going to write

01:08.860 --> 01:12.580
awesome function because this is going to be an awesome function.

01:12.900 --> 01:19.780
And then I have open and close parentheses for right now just use open and close parentheses with nothing

01:19.780 --> 01:22.420
in between I we will get back to this later.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.260
And then this is super important.

01:24.260 --> 01:25.820
This is a colon here.

01:25.860 --> 01:28.340
Do not mistake this for a semicolon.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.980
It's just a regular colon.

01:29.980 --> 01:31.620
It's two dots okay.

01:31.660 --> 01:32.860
And then I hit enter.

01:32.980 --> 01:36.260
Now notice what happens when I hit enter here.

01:36.380 --> 01:42.100
Python actually automatically indented by two spaces okay.

01:42.140 --> 01:46.500
Now when you do this on your computer it might be four spaces.

01:46.900 --> 01:47.500
That's fine.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.380
Python.

01:48.420 --> 01:52.300
You can use indentation for two spaces or four spaces.

01:52.300 --> 01:53.900
And that has the same result.

01:53.900 --> 02:01.870
But that is different from if I do not include the colon here, then when I hit enter and then I start

02:01.870 --> 02:02.710
typing again.

02:02.750 --> 02:05.110
It goes to the very beginning of the line.

02:05.150 --> 02:09.590
Okay, so again we have deaf and then I have some text here.

02:09.750 --> 02:12.070
This is the name of the function.

02:12.190 --> 02:18.830
Just like up here we have some is the name of the function Linspace is the name of a function.

02:19.030 --> 02:22.510
So now we are going to define a new function.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.590
And that function is called awesome function.

02:25.590 --> 02:30.990
And for now no just open and close parentheses and a colon.

02:31.110 --> 02:31.990
Press enter.

02:32.230 --> 02:35.750
And now we can put something into our function.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.550
So what do we want to have in our function.

02:39.070 --> 02:43.270
Well there's nothing super interesting happening in here right now.

02:43.270 --> 02:44.350
Let's write print.

02:44.630 --> 02:45.070
Hi.

02:45.590 --> 02:49.070
And then I will print one plus one okay.

02:49.350 --> 02:53.390
So this function is going to print the string.

02:53.390 --> 02:53.670
Hi.

02:53.830 --> 02:57.270
And then it's going to print the result of one plus one.

02:57.270 --> 02:59.230
And I'm pretty sure that's equal to two.

02:59.350 --> 03:02.730
But we are going to confirm that in Python in a moment.

03:03.690 --> 03:08.290
Okay, so I have written a function and now I go to the next code cell.

03:08.490 --> 03:10.570
And now I can call that function.

03:10.570 --> 03:13.730
I can write awesome function like this.

03:13.930 --> 03:18.530
And now the question is what's going to happen when I run this code cell.

03:18.570 --> 03:21.770
Now the answer is that I will get an error message.

03:21.930 --> 03:23.450
And why do I get an error message?

03:23.450 --> 03:26.330
It says awesome function is not defined.

03:26.810 --> 03:34.290
Whenever you see an error message that says something is not defined, then it's either one of two possibilities.

03:34.290 --> 03:41.210
One is that you are trying to call a function or a variable that really is defined, but you have a

03:41.250 --> 03:42.210
misspelling.

03:42.370 --> 03:48.250
Maybe you mistyped like this, or maybe you forgot some capitalization like this.

03:48.490 --> 03:51.650
So that is one possible reason for this error message.

03:51.890 --> 03:59.210
Another possible reason for this error message is that you wrote code, but you did not yet evaluate

03:59.210 --> 03:59.370
it.

03:59.370 --> 04:00.530
And that's what I did here.

04:00.530 --> 04:06.590
So I wrote this code in this cell, but I haven't actually run this cell, so therefore Python does

04:06.590 --> 04:09.790
not actually recognize this function.

04:10.790 --> 04:11.030
Okay.

04:11.070 --> 04:12.630
So I'm going to run that code cell.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.830
And now I can call this function.

04:15.030 --> 04:22.030
So now we get a high and two confirming my suspicion that one plus one really equals two.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.030
Okay.

04:23.070 --> 04:25.470
Now you know why is this useful.

04:25.550 --> 04:28.910
Well, you know, we can call this function as often as we want.

04:29.270 --> 04:34.350
And now notice that I no longer need to write out the two lines of code.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.870
Print hi and print one plus one.

04:36.910 --> 04:42.990
I can just call this function now in this little simple toy example.

04:43.230 --> 04:44.550
Awesome as it is.

04:45.030 --> 04:49.830
Uh, you know, this is not so necessary to have a function here, right?

04:50.070 --> 04:56.870
But imagine that we have dozens of lines of code, maybe a couple hundred lines of code, and we want

04:56.870 --> 04:58.710
to repeat that multiple times.

04:58.710 --> 05:04.530
So that is a situation where you really need to have a function that you define.

05:05.010 --> 05:05.450
Okay.

05:05.490 --> 05:10.890
One more thing I want to show you before making this function a little bit more complicated, is that

05:10.890 --> 05:17.130
if you just call the name of the function like this without parentheses, you will get a funny looking

05:17.130 --> 05:22.490
result here that just repeats the function name and it.

05:22.650 --> 05:28.010
Well, if we had a docstring in here, then it would give us the help text for this function.

05:28.370 --> 05:32.530
So this is actually just giving us information about the function.

05:32.530 --> 05:39.130
If you want to call the function or run all the code that's contained inside the function, then you

05:39.130 --> 05:41.250
need to have the parentheses here.

05:41.770 --> 05:42.050
Okay.

05:42.090 --> 05:45.690
So now I want to do something else I want to write here print.

05:45.930 --> 05:49.730
Let's write print 17.4 something like that.

05:49.770 --> 05:49.970
Okay.

05:50.010 --> 05:54.930
Now when I run this code then you see the output 17.4.

05:55.210 --> 05:59.250
And now when I run this cell here I only get hi two.

05:59.610 --> 06:02.540
Why do I not see 17.4 four.

06:02.660 --> 06:10.980
In this code cell, the reason is that Python knows how to start and end the definition of the function

06:11.540 --> 06:18.900
according to the colon, which is the start of the function, and also the spacing which will define

06:18.900 --> 06:20.700
the body of the function.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.900
So notice the spacing here.

06:22.940 --> 06:24.620
This is two spaces here.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.420
This is two spaces here.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.460
And here I have no spaces.

06:28.620 --> 06:28.940
Okay.

06:28.980 --> 06:35.580
So this means that Python recognizes that this is the body of the function.

06:35.580 --> 06:39.780
And then when I get out here to this line there's no more space.

06:39.780 --> 06:42.220
Now this is not about the vertical space okay.

06:42.260 --> 06:45.060
We can also do this and get the same result.

06:45.060 --> 06:49.780
So it's about the horizontal spacing not the vertical spacing.

06:50.020 --> 06:54.100
Vertical spacing is great for us to read and interpret this.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.540
You can even do something like this.

06:56.580 --> 06:59.220
End of function definition.

06:59.340 --> 07:03.400
This is great for your understanding of the code.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.200
And then we can go back up here like this.

07:06.920 --> 07:16.160
But Python is defining the function body according to the horizontal spaces that come after the colon.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.840
So this is part of the function.

07:17.840 --> 07:26.760
And of course if we would put in more spaces like this now we are going to get 17.4 because of these

07:26.760 --> 07:32.720
additional spaces in here because of this tab indent okay.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.320
So that's our awesome function.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.280
I will keep that forever.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.160
Just kidding.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.360
I will keep that until the end of this video I guess.

07:39.680 --> 07:45.440
Let's make a new function I'm going to call this function add two numbers.

07:45.600 --> 07:49.520
Now this is going to look slightly different from this function.

07:49.680 --> 07:57.120
Here I'm going to say print uh in one plus in two okay.

07:57.360 --> 08:01.360
Now what I want to do I want this to be in not int okay.

08:01.400 --> 08:10.980
What I want this to do is take in two numbers as inputs and give me the sum, or print out the sum of

08:10.980 --> 08:12.140
those two numbers.

08:12.540 --> 08:13.860
So let's try this.

08:13.860 --> 08:18.460
So I run this code cell to uh to create this function.

08:18.460 --> 08:21.620
And actually I'll just keep working inside this code cell okay.

08:21.660 --> 08:28.580
So now I'm going to call this function add two numbers exactly like how I showed you uh to call this

08:28.580 --> 08:30.420
function here awesome function.

08:30.980 --> 08:32.940
But now we get an error.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.020
No surprise.

08:34.060 --> 08:37.180
The variable in one is not defined.

08:37.220 --> 08:41.620
Now, in this case, we don't have a problem with capitalization or anything like that.

08:42.420 --> 08:46.220
Instead, uh, this really is an undefined variable.

08:46.260 --> 08:49.180
Okay, so I want to give two inputs.

08:49.180 --> 08:52.180
What I want is something like this four comma five.

08:52.460 --> 08:56.460
So I want to provide two inputs into this function.

08:56.780 --> 09:02.300
And the function will add those two inputs together and then print the result.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.830
But this still doesn't work.

09:04.830 --> 09:10.470
So here we get an error message that says takes zero positional arguments, but two were given.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.550
What does this mean?

09:11.870 --> 09:15.150
So this function takes in zero arguments.

09:15.150 --> 09:16.350
What is an argument?

09:16.510 --> 09:20.630
An argument is kind of an old school term for an input.

09:21.030 --> 09:23.190
So zero arguments but two were given.

09:23.190 --> 09:25.670
So I provided two inputs.

09:25.830 --> 09:30.030
And yet the function definition states zero inputs.

09:30.270 --> 09:30.550
Okay.

09:30.590 --> 09:34.430
So what we do here is write in one comma in two.

09:34.910 --> 09:44.590
So now Python will associate this first input with this variable and this second input with this variable.

09:45.070 --> 09:50.190
And now I run this code cell and I get an output of nine.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.430
And why do I get nine.

09:51.430 --> 09:53.270
Because four plus five is nine.

09:53.550 --> 09:53.910
Okay.

09:53.950 --> 09:56.710
And because we're just using the plus sign here.

09:56.710 --> 09:59.070
These don't necessarily need to be numbers.

09:59.070 --> 10:00.750
So I can write hello.

10:01.390 --> 10:08.890
And over here I can write Space World, and then I get an output of Hello World because we are applying

10:08.890 --> 10:13.690
the plus sign to strings, which does string concatenation.

10:14.890 --> 10:22.290
As you know from the previous video and earlier videos, some functions can also provide outputs.

10:22.290 --> 10:23.770
So how do we do that?

10:24.050 --> 10:30.250
Okay, so what I am going to do here is add to this function a calculation.

10:30.250 --> 10:38.410
This is going to be the sum I'll call this the sum equals n1 plus n2.

10:38.690 --> 10:44.690
And then I'm going to provide an output using the return reserved keyword.

10:44.730 --> 10:45.890
Again it's turn.

10:45.890 --> 10:48.010
It's changing color as I finish typing.

10:48.010 --> 10:51.170
So return the sum okay.

10:51.210 --> 10:52.250
So now let's see.

10:52.250 --> 10:53.570
Let's get this back to numbers.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.410
I'll just say three three and four.

10:56.410 --> 10:57.890
Like this okay.

10:57.930 --> 11:02.330
So now when I call this function I provide these two inputs.

11:02.490 --> 11:05.430
It no longer prints any information.

11:05.430 --> 11:07.550
Instead, it's going to give an output.

11:07.550 --> 11:12.830
And that output is going to be one number, which is the sum of the two inputs.

11:13.310 --> 11:21.590
So I can run this and I get a result seven and now I can write here result equals uh the output of this

11:21.590 --> 11:22.150
function.

11:22.150 --> 11:23.790
And then I'll check this result okay.

11:23.830 --> 11:26.230
And then the result is seven okay.

11:26.270 --> 11:31.310
So now actually I think I will I'm going to make some uh more significant changes.

11:31.310 --> 11:34.550
So I also want to change the name of this function.

11:34.670 --> 11:37.350
Let's call this uh my function.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.390
Still going to take two inputs.

11:39.550 --> 11:47.470
And now I'm going to, uh, have an additional calculation in this function called the prod for product.

11:47.470 --> 11:50.350
So in one times in two.

11:50.830 --> 11:52.870
Now when I run this again let me see.

11:52.870 --> 11:55.190
This is now called my function.

11:56.390 --> 11:59.790
I'm still only getting the answer of seven.

11:59.790 --> 12:02.350
I'm only getting an output of seven.

12:02.670 --> 12:03.710
And what does that mean.

12:03.710 --> 12:07.120
That means that this calculation was actually run.

12:07.280 --> 12:12.840
So Python really did multiply these two numbers, but it just didn't do anything.

12:12.840 --> 12:17.720
This is an internal calculation and it was not given as an output.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.840
And so the calculation happened.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.520
But then it's gone.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.960
It's no longer appears in our lovely universe.

12:24.960 --> 12:28.280
And you can see this by writing out the product.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.520
And now this product is not defined.

12:30.560 --> 12:34.400
This variable was really created inside this function.

12:34.400 --> 12:41.920
But as soon as we exited this function, the scope of this function was destroyed, meaning that variable

12:41.920 --> 12:43.520
name is deleted.

12:43.520 --> 12:47.920
The variable no longer exists, but we do want that function.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.360
So how do we get multiple outputs?

12:50.360 --> 12:56.960
Well, you might think of doing something like this, but this is only going to still give us the number

12:56.960 --> 12:57.520
seven.

12:57.720 --> 13:03.200
Because basically this line of code runs and then Python just exits the function.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.860
This is also really bad programming.

13:05.860 --> 13:07.180
You shouldn't do something like this.

13:07.460 --> 13:11.540
Okay, so instead we can put a comma in here.

13:11.540 --> 13:18.220
And then this output is going to be in the form of a variable type called a tuple okay.

13:18.260 --> 13:21.540
So now what you see I have the sum and the prod.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.100
And now I call this function.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.340
And now I get both.

13:24.340 --> 13:33.900
So seven is three plus four and 12 is the second output which is three times four okay.

13:33.940 --> 13:37.220
So this result is now a two elements.

13:37.220 --> 13:39.700
And what is this type of variable.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.820
So you can see it has parentheses.

13:42.820 --> 13:44.220
So it's not a list right.

13:44.260 --> 13:46.300
Lists have square brackets.

13:46.580 --> 13:48.780
This result has parentheses.

13:48.940 --> 13:49.580
So let's see.

13:49.580 --> 13:52.100
This is of type tuple.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.580
A tuple is like a list.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.780
It's almost the same thing as a list.

13:56.820 --> 14:02.780
The main difference is that lists are what's called mutable, which means you can change the values

14:02.780 --> 14:03.660
of a list.

14:04.020 --> 14:09.280
A tuple is immutable, which means you cannot change the values of the list.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.920
So for example, we cannot write.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.160
So we can still index like this.

14:14.160 --> 14:21.880
But we cannot change the result here because the tuple does not support item assignment, which basically

14:21.880 --> 14:28.520
means that once you have a tuple, you cannot change the information in a tuple, but otherwise a tuple

14:28.520 --> 14:31.760
and a list are basically the same kind of variable.

14:32.320 --> 14:32.760
Okay.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.520
Very nice.

14:33.520 --> 14:39.160
Let's say we only want to access the first element of this result.

14:39.160 --> 14:43.840
Or maybe we want to separate them into two different variables instead of one variable.

14:44.160 --> 14:51.000
So let's call this result s for sum and result p for prod for product.

14:51.320 --> 14:57.760
So now you can see I have a function with two inputs and it provides two outputs.

14:57.760 --> 15:05.420
And each of those outputs is just a single number corresponding to the sum and the product.

15:05.940 --> 15:10.260
So let's review what I have taught you about functions.

15:10.500 --> 15:17.220
You create your own functions in Python using the def keyword for define.

15:17.260 --> 15:22.580
After def you have a space in here and then the name of the function.

15:22.780 --> 15:25.940
And you always need open and close parentheses.

15:26.260 --> 15:30.180
If you have inputs then you list those inputs.

15:30.220 --> 15:34.140
The variable names of those inputs here inside the parentheses.

15:34.140 --> 15:39.820
If you don't need any inputs then you still need the parentheses, but you just leave it empty in between.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.500
After the parentheses you need a colon.

15:43.700 --> 15:50.620
And this tells Python that everything after the colon is the body or the definition of the function.

15:50.940 --> 15:58.260
And then after the colon, you need every line that is inside the function to have either two spaces

15:58.260 --> 15:59.340
or four spaces.

15:59.340 --> 16:07.310
It doesn't actually matter whether it's two spaces or four spaces, but it needs to be consistent within

16:07.310 --> 16:07.870
the code.

16:07.870 --> 16:09.590
So this you cannot do.

16:09.630 --> 16:15.430
You can see uh, Python or Jupyter Notebook is already giving me lots of red lines.

16:15.430 --> 16:20.070
So everything has to be with two spaces or with four spaces, but not a mix.

16:20.550 --> 16:20.870
Okay.

16:20.910 --> 16:27.270
And then, uh, all of the code that is inside the body of the function is indented.

16:27.550 --> 16:34.350
And then if you want to provide outputs to give outside the function the result of your calculations,

16:34.790 --> 16:37.350
you use the keyword return.

16:37.710 --> 16:41.070
And then you list all of the outputs okay.

16:41.110 --> 16:42.030
And then that's it.

16:42.030 --> 16:45.710
Then when the function is finished you have no more spaces.

16:45.710 --> 16:50.430
So you go back in indentation to the beginning of the code.

16:50.430 --> 16:54.790
So this is one way to define a function.

16:54.790 --> 16:55.870
In Python.

16:55.990 --> 17:05.810
These are sometimes called named functions or standard functions in Python, and that you can contrast

17:05.810 --> 17:13.170
with what I will now show you, which is called a lambda expression, which is also sometimes called

17:13.170 --> 17:18.490
a lambda function, and it's also sometimes called an anonymous function.

17:18.690 --> 17:26.690
Now I have to say these are my least favorite terms to call these named functions and anonymous functions,

17:26.690 --> 17:28.050
because they're both named.

17:28.650 --> 17:34.490
So I call these you know, I think it's better to call these standard functions and call these lambda

17:34.490 --> 17:35.370
expressions.

17:35.530 --> 17:43.010
Anyway, the idea is that this takes up lots of lines of code, which is great if you have a long function,

17:43.250 --> 17:49.530
but sometimes you have a short little function that you only need a little bit of code for really just

17:49.530 --> 17:50.850
one line of code.

17:50.970 --> 17:54.850
And then you can create a lambda expression or a lambda function.

17:55.770 --> 18:00.170
And I'll call that little fun as an example equals lambda.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.090
Again look at this keyword here.

18:02.090 --> 18:03.370
It's reserved keyword.

18:03.370 --> 18:05.570
It changes color x.

18:06.550 --> 18:07.510
uh, colon.

18:07.630 --> 18:12.710
And then I don't know, let's do like x squared minus one or something like that.

18:13.030 --> 18:13.310
Okay.

18:13.350 --> 18:19.790
So what I have done here is create a function where it takes as input x.

18:20.110 --> 18:25.150
And the function is defined by this little expression here.

18:25.470 --> 18:34.070
So I hope you can see actually what I think I will do is write uh rewrite this function using standard

18:34.070 --> 18:35.030
def format.

18:35.030 --> 18:43.950
So def little Fun2 x and then return x squared minus one.

18:44.470 --> 18:44.870
Okay.

18:45.310 --> 18:48.870
These two expressions are exactly the same.

18:48.870 --> 18:55.630
They take the same input and they calculate the same number and they provide the same output.

18:56.350 --> 18:59.710
Uh I think you can see that this is a nice formulation.

18:59.910 --> 19:06.440
If you have just a really quick little function that you want to work with, and then this does not

19:06.440 --> 19:08.480
support multiple lines of code.

19:08.480 --> 19:13.960
If you need more than one line of code to express your function, you don't use a lambda expression.

19:13.960 --> 19:17.200
You use a standard function, a regular function.

19:18.200 --> 19:18.440
Okay.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.320
And then, you know, we can just provide input.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.640
So little fun for okay.

19:22.680 --> 19:26.400
So four squared minus one is 15 okay.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.840
And then we can confirm that we get the same result here.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.080
That concludes this video on functions.

19:33.080 --> 19:42.080
Once you get deeper into Python knowledge you will discover additional things you can include in functions,

19:42.280 --> 19:46.200
additional ways of defining functions and working with functions.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.240
And that's all fine.

19:47.240 --> 19:52.880
But this is the basic uh, this is basically all you need to know about functions for certainly for

19:52.880 --> 19:53.640
this course.

19:53.800 --> 20:01.480
And just writing out functions like this with inputs and outputs and calculations in between, that

20:01.480 --> 20:04.840
will get you very far in Python coding.
