00:01.840 --> 00:08.960
So far in this Python tutorial, we've been writing out all the code that we need directly into these

00:08.960 --> 00:09.880
code cells.

00:10.320 --> 00:17.080
Now that's fine when you only have a little bit of code that needs to be run, but it happens very often

00:17.080 --> 00:23.560
that there are particular pieces of code or chunks of code that you need to run multiple times.

00:23.560 --> 00:30.240
You want to implement some kind of calculation or maybe a complicated set of calculations many, many

00:30.240 --> 00:31.000
times.

00:31.440 --> 00:37.880
And for that, it's convenient to package up all of the lines of code that you need so that you can

00:37.880 --> 00:44.160
call them once, repeatedly, without having to rewrite the code over and over and over again.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.760
And that is the idea of a function.

00:47.040 --> 00:55.960
So a function in Python or in coding languages in general, is a set of code lines that you keep sometimes

00:55.960 --> 00:59.200
in a separate code cell or sometimes in a separate file.

00:59.640 --> 01:05.330
And then you can repeatedly call those sets of code lines multiple times.

01:05.570 --> 01:11.090
Okay, now you've already seen several functions in the past couple of videos.

01:11.090 --> 01:14.930
For example, we've been using the function print an awful lot.

01:15.130 --> 01:18.650
There's a couple of other common functions like Len for length.

01:19.090 --> 01:25.290
You've seen type to extract the type of variable of a particular variable that we create.

01:25.690 --> 01:29.810
Here's another one that I'm going to introduce you to this type.

01:29.970 --> 01:31.890
Or this function is called sum.

01:32.090 --> 01:33.610
And can you guess what it does.

01:33.770 --> 01:36.890
It sums up a set of numbers.

01:36.890 --> 01:41.690
So for example if I type sum and then here I'm entering a list.

01:41.730 --> 01:45.450
You can tell that this is a list by the square brackets.

01:45.570 --> 01:49.050
So notice let me zoom in to ludicrous proportions here.

01:49.490 --> 01:53.970
Here I have parentheses and I have square brackets.

01:54.130 --> 01:57.610
So the parentheses are indicating a function.

01:58.010 --> 02:03.620
And inside the function I'll put some spaces here and make it even more visible inside the function.

02:03.620 --> 02:09.220
I'm providing a list and this is a list because it has square brackets.

02:10.140 --> 02:13.020
Okay, so this is called the input into the function.

02:13.060 --> 02:15.700
Get back to human size zoom scale here.

02:16.060 --> 02:18.980
So this is an input into the function.

02:19.140 --> 02:22.540
Functions take inputs and they provide outputs.

02:22.540 --> 02:26.340
In this case I'm giving one function input.

02:26.340 --> 02:28.220
And now I'm going to run this code cell.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.220
And the answer is 60.

02:30.260 --> 02:32.780
Or the message that prints out is 60.

02:33.180 --> 02:35.340
And what is this number here.

02:35.340 --> 02:36.940
And what does that correspond to.

02:36.980 --> 02:38.420
Well I'm sure you've figured it out.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.780
That is the sum of these three numbers.

02:40.780 --> 02:43.500
So ten plus 20 plus 30 equals 60.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.580
So I can add another number here.

02:45.580 --> 02:46.620
Let's say one.

02:46.620 --> 02:47.220
So there you go.

02:47.220 --> 02:48.500
Now I have 61.

02:48.940 --> 02:53.980
And we can also input variables into a function.

02:53.980 --> 02:57.740
So here I'm going to write a list.

02:57.780 --> 02:58.700
And this is my list.

02:58.700 --> 03:03.780
And now the input into this sum function is a list okay.

03:03.980 --> 03:10.710
And now, uh, functions can only most functions take very specific types of inputs.

03:10.710 --> 03:17.070
So for example, the function sum only makes sense if we are inputting numbers.

03:17.070 --> 03:20.350
So if I would start inputting a string like this.

03:20.350 --> 03:20.750
Hi.

03:20.990 --> 03:23.150
Now this is completely fine.

03:23.150 --> 03:25.030
There's nothing wrong with this list.

03:25.030 --> 03:32.430
But if I try to sum then we get an error message and the error message is unsupported.

03:32.430 --> 03:35.790
Operand types for plus int and string.

03:35.790 --> 03:36.910
So what does this mean?

03:37.270 --> 03:42.870
Well, an operand is a symbol that's used to indicate a particular operation.

03:43.150 --> 03:46.030
And in this case the operand is plus sign.

03:46.030 --> 03:48.550
So we are trying to add together.

03:48.830 --> 03:57.390
Now you have seen in several videos ago that the plus sign is overloaded in Python, meaning that three

03:57.430 --> 03:59.550
plus three is six.

03:59.950 --> 04:05.920
But let's say Mike plus I'll do the space.

04:05.920 --> 04:06.480
Coen.

04:06.720 --> 04:10.640
This is going to give one, uh, result, one string of my code.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.120
So it's concatenating these.

04:12.520 --> 04:12.760
Okay.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.640
So the question is, you know, what do we do when we have a situation like this?

04:16.680 --> 04:18.320
What is Python supposed to do?

04:18.480 --> 04:21.120
This is not the same thing as the string theory.

04:21.120 --> 04:21.920
That works fine.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.400
Here we get Mike Cohen three.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.000
But if this is the number three.

04:26.360 --> 04:34.440
Now Python doesn't know what to do with this because we are trying to use the same operator in very

04:34.440 --> 04:37.600
different ways on very different types of variables.

04:38.760 --> 04:39.040
Okay.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.640
And that is the problem here.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.280
So we get this error message here okay.

04:43.320 --> 04:48.520
So that is a bit about uh functions and inputs.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.280
Functions can also provide outputs.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.960
So let's say I'll just call this the output put put let's say output like this.

04:56.320 --> 05:01.040
Now when I run this code again I don't get any errors, I don't get any warning messages.

05:01.040 --> 05:05.440
But I no longer see the output of this cell.

05:05.440 --> 05:06.810
So where did that go?

05:07.010 --> 05:08.450
Well, it's still there.

05:08.490 --> 05:11.730
It's just assigned to this variable output.

05:11.890 --> 05:20.610
So you will see the output of a code cell after the cell only when it's the final line of the cell,

05:20.610 --> 05:22.610
only for the final line of the cell.

05:22.850 --> 05:27.090
And if it does not involve variable assignment.

05:27.090 --> 05:32.370
So this final line of code in this cell actually does create a variable.

05:32.370 --> 05:33.970
It assigns a variable.

05:33.970 --> 05:38.570
So therefore the output into the notebook is suppressed.

05:38.770 --> 05:39.850
Those are the rules.

05:39.850 --> 05:43.770
I don't know why Python developers do that, but that's just how it works.

05:44.090 --> 05:49.850
If we want to see what is the value of output, then we can type it in here like this.

05:49.850 --> 05:54.730
So now this is the final piece of code, the final line of code in this code cell.

05:54.970 --> 05:57.410
And there's no assignment involved.

05:57.410 --> 05:59.810
It's just that variable here.

05:59.930 --> 06:00.970
So we can do this.

06:00.970 --> 06:04.250
And of course you know we can also use the print function.

06:05.010 --> 06:05.330
Okay.

06:05.370 --> 06:11.190
So now you have seen that functions can take inputs and functions can provide outputs.

06:11.230 --> 06:13.630
Some functions take multiple inputs.

06:13.630 --> 06:16.310
Some functions provide multiple outputs.

06:16.430 --> 06:20.550
Some functions don't provide any outputs or don't take any inputs.

06:20.550 --> 06:25.790
It's really dependent on the nature of the function and what the function is calculating.

06:26.310 --> 06:26.710
Okay.

06:26.750 --> 06:27.790
And now let's see.

06:27.790 --> 06:30.790
So we have the sum of all of these numbers.

06:30.790 --> 06:36.030
And we also know how to calculate the length of these numbers or this list here.

06:36.030 --> 06:37.990
So there's four elements in this list.

06:37.990 --> 06:42.070
And that I get from this function Len for length.

06:42.390 --> 06:46.950
Now what if we wanted to compute the average or the mean of these numbers.

06:47.110 --> 06:53.310
Well the algorithm to calculate the average of a set of numbers is you sum up all the numbers and then

06:53.310 --> 06:55.950
you divide by the number of numbers.

06:56.390 --> 07:01.870
So let's create another variable here I will call this variable list count.

07:01.910 --> 07:02.710
How about that.

07:02.910 --> 07:03.790
So list count.

07:03.830 --> 07:09.960
And now we can calculate the average of the list by dividing the output.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.360
And actually this is a terrible variable name.

07:12.360 --> 07:16.640
I'm going to call this a sum of list okay.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.520
And then I will just delete this here.

07:19.520 --> 07:24.280
By the way you see an example of using Snakecase over here.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.440
And this is camel case.

07:26.800 --> 07:33.920
As I mentioned before, you will find angry people on the internet who like to say that you should only

07:33.920 --> 07:36.200
do one or the other, and you should be consistent.

07:36.400 --> 07:44.080
My personal opinion is as long as your variable names are clear and readable and meaningful, I really

07:44.080 --> 07:47.200
don't think it's a big deal what flavor of casing you use.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.440
Okay, so here I have a variable sum of list.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.920
And here is list count.

07:52.240 --> 08:03.160
And now to calculate the average let's do this average of numbers I'm going to say sum of list divided

08:03.160 --> 08:04.400
by list count.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.880
And let's see what the average of numbers is.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.290
Ah this is very interesting.

08:10.290 --> 08:15.130
I actually did not do this on purpose, but this is a great learning opportunity.

08:15.330 --> 08:20.210
Here we get an error message and the error message is list count is not defined.

08:20.250 --> 08:25.610
Now when you first see this error message you might be confused because hey you know what's the deal

08:25.610 --> 08:25.850
here?

08:25.890 --> 08:32.810
Python I actually did define list count, but you'll remember that variable names are case sensitive.

08:33.090 --> 08:34.970
So here this is just a little typo.

08:35.010 --> 08:38.450
I didn't capitalize the C over here.

08:38.690 --> 08:46.490
So list count lowercase c is a completely completely different beast from list count uppercase C.

08:46.930 --> 08:54.090
So the average of this set of numbers this list of numbers is 15.25 okay.

08:54.290 --> 08:57.090
Now why do we have to write out this entire algorithm?

08:57.090 --> 09:02.770
Maybe Python has a function for the average and we can write average a list.

09:03.170 --> 09:04.890
Okay, so that doesn't work.

09:05.130 --> 09:06.610
Uh, maybe it's mean.

09:07.890 --> 09:08.250
Uh huh.

09:08.290 --> 09:09.570
That also doesn't work.

09:09.770 --> 09:16.660
Okay, so this means that if we are just working in base Python, any time we want to calculate the

09:16.660 --> 09:23.460
average of a set of numbers, we need to write out the entire algorithm all by ourselves.

09:23.660 --> 09:27.780
Now, in this toy example, that's not such a big deal, right?

09:27.820 --> 09:31.140
The algorithm for calculating the average is not so long.

09:31.420 --> 09:31.860
Who cares?

09:31.860 --> 09:32.740
We can do this.

09:33.220 --> 09:38.860
That's fine for this case, but there are other algorithms that you will want to implement that end

09:38.860 --> 09:42.980
up being tens of lines of code or hundreds of lines of code long.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.540
And so you will.

09:44.860 --> 09:48.580
So it becomes really tedious to have to write out all that code.

09:48.820 --> 09:58.100
And that's why we have functions that are stored in dedicated libraries like NumPy, matplotlib, PyTorch,

09:58.140 --> 10:01.100
SciPy, SciPy, pandas.

10:01.140 --> 10:05.300
There's tons and tons of libraries in Python that are frequently used.

10:05.660 --> 10:10.900
Okay, but that is the segue to the next video on libraries.
