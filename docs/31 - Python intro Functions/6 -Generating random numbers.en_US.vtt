00:01.840 --> 00:08.120
In this video I will show you multiple ways to generate random numbers.

00:08.120 --> 00:11.840
So this number you might think it's random because I just came up with it.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.680
Here's another random number.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.640
Maybe I'll put a decimal point here that's kind of random because I'm just playing around on the keyboard.

00:18.640 --> 00:26.520
But maybe we want to generate hundreds or thousands, or maybe even millions of random numbers.

00:26.520 --> 00:33.440
We need to generate lots of random numbers in deep learning, because when we train deep learning models,

00:33.440 --> 00:37.360
we start with a model full of random weights.

00:37.360 --> 00:40.120
So we need to initialize a bunch of random numbers.

00:40.120 --> 00:43.680
And this is going to be literally millions of random numbers.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.760
And so I'm not going to sit around all day and just do it here.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.040
I already messed up here.

00:48.560 --> 00:48.960
Okay.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.400
Anyway, there is a module in numpy called numpy dot random.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.240
So it's a module which means it's kind of like a library inside of a library.

01:01.680 --> 01:10.400
So you learned how to use, uh, functions that are inside a library by writing the name of the library

01:10.400 --> 01:13.920
and then a dot a period and then the name of the function.

01:14.360 --> 01:21.040
So you can also have something like a mini library that's embedded inside another library.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.000
And that's generally called a module.

01:23.040 --> 01:23.320
Okay.

01:23.360 --> 01:27.800
So there is a module in numpy called random.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.720
So now I write numpy dot random dot.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.280
So it's a second dot.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.480
And let's start with the function rand n.

01:36.960 --> 01:44.760
So the rand of course is for random and the n is for normal distribution or Gaussian distribution.

01:44.880 --> 01:50.240
This means numbers that are drawn from a distribution with a mean of zero.

01:50.240 --> 01:54.600
So an average number of zero and a standard deviation of one.

01:54.600 --> 01:58.880
And basically that means that we're going to get some negative numbers and some positive numbers.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.640
So here I get minus two point blah blah blah.

02:03.280 --> 02:08.230
I'm sure if you run this code on your computer you got a completely different number.

02:08.350 --> 02:10.590
In fact, I'm going to run this multiple times.

02:10.590 --> 02:14.510
And you can see every time I run exactly the same code.

02:14.670 --> 02:17.470
The code isn't changing, but the output is changing.

02:17.710 --> 02:19.310
And why is the output changing?

02:19.310 --> 02:21.710
Because it's generating random numbers.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.470
Okay, so this is one random number.

02:24.590 --> 02:29.430
If I want ten random numbers I just put ten in here.

02:29.710 --> 02:32.110
And now I get a numpy array.

02:32.590 --> 02:38.470
And you can see it's 12345 by two now.

02:38.630 --> 02:40.230
So that's ten numbers in total.

02:41.270 --> 02:43.790
This looks like it's a matrix.

02:43.790 --> 02:48.390
It looks like it's a two by five matrix of numbers.

02:48.590 --> 02:50.510
But it's not really a matrix.

02:50.510 --> 02:52.830
Python is just printing out.

02:53.230 --> 02:56.670
It's wrapping around this array when it prints out.

02:56.790 --> 03:01.870
So this is so this is just 110 element vector.

03:02.070 --> 03:10.030
We can actually create a two by five matrix of random numbers by inputting a two comma five.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.470
And then the result is.

03:12.910 --> 03:19.230
Now, initially this might look the same, but we have to be really careful about the let me do this

03:19.230 --> 03:20.590
to make sure this is clear.

03:22.150 --> 03:24.710
The square brackets here.

03:24.710 --> 03:32.190
So notice there are two differences between this output and this output.

03:32.470 --> 03:36.030
One difference is that the numbers themselves are different.

03:36.030 --> 03:37.630
But these are just random numbers.

03:37.630 --> 03:39.110
So don't pay any attention to that.

03:40.190 --> 03:46.790
What I do want you to pay attention to is the number and the placement of the square brackets.

03:47.150 --> 03:56.310
So here when I write random dot rand n with just ten, then we get one opening bracket here, no closing

03:56.310 --> 03:57.030
bracket here.

03:57.030 --> 03:58.870
And there's a closing bracket here.

03:58.990 --> 04:02.390
So this is like one list okay.

04:02.430 --> 04:06.270
And then here this is two by five as the input.

04:06.310 --> 04:14.750
Now notice that here there are two open brackets one closing bracket here one opening bracket and two

04:14.950 --> 04:16.070
closing brackets.

04:16.230 --> 04:19.790
So what's really happening is that there are two sets.

04:20.030 --> 04:24.990
This is one set of numbers, one like list of numbers.

04:25.150 --> 04:25.990
It's a row.

04:26.430 --> 04:29.270
And here is a second row here.

04:29.670 --> 04:33.750
And the rows are encased by square brackets.

04:34.150 --> 04:39.430
And then we have two rows forming a matrix or a two dimensional array.

04:39.710 --> 04:44.870
And that is contained inside another square bracket.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.150
Okay I hope that makes sense.

04:46.190 --> 04:49.590
So the difference between two comma five and ten.

04:49.830 --> 04:52.150
Now we can do this two comma three.

04:52.190 --> 04:52.430
Yeah.

04:52.430 --> 04:56.230
So we can specify the size of this matrix here.

04:57.030 --> 04:57.390
Okay.

04:57.430 --> 05:01.230
So this is normally distributed random numbers.

05:01.230 --> 05:07.270
Here we can also access or create uniformly distributed random numbers.

05:07.310 --> 05:14.670
Now uniform distribution means all the numbers between 0 and 1 are equally likely to occur.

05:15.110 --> 05:22.580
But what if we want uniformly distributed numbers between about minus one and plus three.

05:23.060 --> 05:26.020
So now I can use two inputs here.

05:26.020 --> 05:28.220
And this corresponds to the lower bound.

05:28.220 --> 05:32.980
And this is the upper bound of the uniform distributed random numbers.

05:33.300 --> 05:38.860
We can also optionally specify lo equals this and high equals this.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.300
So this is one number.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.820
And then I'm going to write size equals ten by ten.

05:43.820 --> 05:47.260
And now this gives me a ten by ten matrix.

05:47.260 --> 05:49.180
So 100 numbers in total.

05:49.700 --> 05:54.020
Uh random numbers between minus one and plus three.

05:54.340 --> 05:56.180
And again you can see the brackets here.

05:56.180 --> 05:59.820
So I have an open bracket and a closed bracket down here.

06:00.220 --> 06:05.900
And then each of the rows is one opening bracket and one small bracket.

06:05.900 --> 06:10.420
And then if you count these there should be ten of these rows okay.

06:10.780 --> 06:12.860
Uh normally distributed random numbers.

06:12.860 --> 06:16.020
So Gaussian distribution uniform distribution.

06:16.020 --> 06:21.620
We can also create random integers numpy.random dot rand int.

06:22.100 --> 06:25.220
and here let's say -4 to 5.

06:25.220 --> 06:31.100
And then I'm going to have like a tuple three comma five okay.

06:31.140 --> 06:36.940
So this is going to give me random integers as low as minus four.

06:37.300 --> 06:40.300
And this is a little tricky here as high as four.

06:40.780 --> 06:48.940
This is an exclusive upper bound meaning that the number five is never going to appear in the output

06:48.980 --> 06:50.180
of this function.

06:50.660 --> 06:50.900
Okay.

06:50.940 --> 06:55.060
And then the size that I want is going to be three by five.

06:55.060 --> 06:57.620
So three rows and five columns.

06:57.620 --> 06:59.460
And here we see all of those numbers.

06:59.460 --> 07:03.660
So now you can see the numbers between minus four.

07:03.700 --> 07:04.940
So here's a minus four.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.820
Here's a plus four I'll run this again.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.100
We're not going to see any fives.

07:10.260 --> 07:14.540
So inclusive upper bound exclusive upper bound.

07:14.540 --> 07:19.300
When we're working with integers or whole numbers that's just how it is.

07:19.340 --> 07:21.820
Of course we can give this an output.

07:21.820 --> 07:26.580
Let's call this int match for integer matrix.

07:26.740 --> 07:31.860
And now I don't see the output, but it is stored in the int mat variable.

07:32.820 --> 07:39.860
There is one more random function that I would like to introduce you to, and that is called choice.

07:39.900 --> 07:43.540
In particular, it is Numpy.random choice.

07:44.020 --> 07:52.540
And the idea of this function is that we provide an input of some set of numbers, and Python will randomly

07:52.540 --> 07:55.540
choose one of those numbers.

07:55.700 --> 07:59.860
So let's do let's create linearly spaced numbers between.

07:59.860 --> 08:06.740
So I'll do numpy dot linspace between about minus four and plus I don't know 12345.

08:06.740 --> 08:11.340
And let's have 85 numbers between them.

08:11.340 --> 08:12.940
So let's just look and see what this is.

08:13.380 --> 08:13.700
Okay.

08:13.740 --> 08:20.900
So here we get numbers from minus four up to 12345 in listed in scientific notation here.

08:21.300 --> 08:21.500
Okay.

08:21.540 --> 08:26.540
Now let's say we want to choose one of those numbers at random.

08:26.660 --> 08:29.850
So I can write ln for linear numbers.

08:29.850 --> 08:32.530
Linearly spaced numbers comma one.

08:32.570 --> 08:37.970
And now Python is just going to pick one of those numbers at random.

08:38.130 --> 08:38.290
Okay.

08:38.290 --> 08:40.730
And I can run this again and again and again.

08:40.730 --> 08:42.570
And we keep getting different results.

08:42.570 --> 08:48.970
Because each of these numbers has a one inch 85 chance of being selected.

08:49.330 --> 08:49.610
Okay.

08:49.650 --> 08:52.210
And then yeah let's say we want 13 of these.

08:52.330 --> 08:57.650
So now we're getting 13 of these numbers being selected by chance.

08:57.650 --> 09:03.730
So each time I run this over and over again I'm going to get a different set of numbers.

09:03.730 --> 09:10.490
But every single one of these numbers comes directly from this array over here.

09:11.450 --> 09:11.810
Okay.

09:11.850 --> 09:20.610
So this was an introduction to the Numpy.random module and in particular several different ways of generating

09:20.770 --> 09:29.010
random numbers from various distributions, floating point numbers and integers, and also random selections

09:29.010 --> 09:31.570
from existing sets of numbers.
