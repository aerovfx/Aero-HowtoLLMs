00:01.840 --> 00:10.080
I ended the previous video by lamenting that there is no Python function called mean when.

00:10.080 --> 00:13.720
All I want to do is get the average of a set of numbers.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.240
So this brings me to libraries.

00:16.280 --> 00:24.800
A library is a set of functions and some other attributes, but mostly a lot of functions that are bundled

00:24.800 --> 00:27.680
together because they're somehow related to each other.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.840
So numpy is a library in Python.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.320
The num is for.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.240
Let me write this out num pi.

00:36.920 --> 00:40.040
So the num is for numbers or numerical.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.200
And pi of course is for Python.

00:42.520 --> 00:50.760
So numpy is a package of lots and lots of functions that are used for numerical processing.

00:51.280 --> 00:55.200
And of course, you know deep learning is all about numbers.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.840
So or it's implemented all through math and numbers.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.280
So therefore we're going to use numpy quite a bit in this course.

01:02.280 --> 01:05.020
Also PyTorch and lots of other libraries.

01:05.340 --> 01:07.740
Okay, but so let me introduce you to numpy.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.460
So how do we get numpy?

01:09.460 --> 01:13.860
If I just try running this, we get an error message that says numpy is not defined.

01:15.020 --> 01:23.260
One of the ideas, the philosophies of Python, is that it should be lightweight and simple to use,

01:23.260 --> 01:26.100
and easy to install and package together.

01:26.420 --> 01:32.180
So that means that the base Python, which we've been working with so far in all the videos, doesn't

01:32.180 --> 01:34.060
really have that many functions.

01:34.060 --> 01:40.100
It has a core set of functions, and beyond that, it just doesn't really do a whole lot.

01:40.500 --> 01:48.660
So that's good because it means that numpy is fast to install and to start on any computer, any kind

01:48.660 --> 01:51.580
of hardware, or even like on your phone.

01:52.180 --> 01:56.980
Uh, but it means that it's that base Python is very limited in its functionality.

01:57.220 --> 01:57.500
Okay.

01:57.540 --> 02:05.060
So what we want to do is import the numpy library so that we can access the functions that are contained

02:05.060 --> 02:06.140
in numpy.

02:07.300 --> 02:13.630
And so the formulation for doing that, the syntax for importing a library is you type import.

02:13.630 --> 02:16.630
And notice that now this is a black text.

02:16.670 --> 02:21.910
And when I finish the word import it becomes this nice magenta color.

02:22.270 --> 02:23.870
So import numpy.

02:23.910 --> 02:27.870
This imports the library into the Python workspace.

02:28.230 --> 02:31.910
And now it's also common to use an abbreviation.

02:32.070 --> 02:37.990
So rather than having to write out the entire word numpy we are going to write out NP.

02:38.270 --> 02:41.950
I know it's not saving that much time, it's only three letters shorter.

02:41.950 --> 02:49.150
But somehow, you know, if you if you use numpy a lot then typing, you know, dropping these three

02:49.150 --> 02:55.390
letters is going to save you minutes of your life over the course of years of using Python anyway.

02:56.070 --> 03:00.710
So import numpy as NP nothing happened in the output.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.070
There's no output of this.

03:03.070 --> 03:09.310
But what this does is bring the numpy library into our current Python session.

03:09.510 --> 03:16.360
And now we can access all of the functionalities, all the functions that are contained in the NumPy

03:16.400 --> 03:17.160
library.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.280
And how do we access these?

03:19.280 --> 03:26.000
By typing the name of the library or the abbreviation that we used here, and then the name of the function.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.120
So numpy dot mean.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.680
And now I can write in a list.

03:30.680 --> 03:36.520
And now we get the number 15.25 exactly as we calculated over here.

03:36.880 --> 03:41.640
So that means that this function mean actually does exist in Python.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.400
It's just not provided by base Python.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.480
It's provided by the numpy library.

03:47.480 --> 03:51.400
And we need to access it using this dot over here.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.920
And then you can see you know this still doesn't give us anything.

03:54.960 --> 03:55.240
Okay.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.640
So numpy dot mean.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.760
Now this output here looks slightly different from this output here.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.640
This is just a floating point number.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.280
And here we actually get numpy dot float64.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.120
And then the output.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.600
So this is in fact a different data type.

04:12.840 --> 04:18.060
And let me I'll call this variable M and then I will write type m.

04:18.060 --> 04:25.420
So now we can see that this variable m which is the output of this function numpy dot mean is of type

04:25.420 --> 04:27.180
numpy dot float.

04:27.180 --> 04:30.100
So 64 bit precision and float.

04:30.140 --> 04:30.940
So there you go.

04:30.980 --> 04:37.140
That's a new data type that you can learn about uh how many functions are there in numpy.

04:37.180 --> 04:38.900
I don't personally know the answer.

04:39.100 --> 04:43.220
Uh, I suppose it would be relatively easy to Google that and get the answer.

04:44.060 --> 04:47.380
Most functions in numpy you probably won't use.

04:47.380 --> 04:50.380
There are functions that you will use pretty often.

04:50.420 --> 04:51.580
Mean is one.

04:51.780 --> 04:55.580
Uh, Linspace is a function that gets used quite often.

04:55.780 --> 04:58.340
Linspace takes three inputs.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.060
The first input.

05:00.060 --> 05:02.900
Actually, let me just show it to you and then I will discuss.

05:03.220 --> 05:03.740
Uh, okay.

05:03.780 --> 05:10.460
So let's say one comma six comma 19, uh, and the output is a set of numbers.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.100
And there are 19 of them.

05:12.220 --> 05:17.100
We can tell that there's 19 because there's one, two, three, four, five.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.640
So that's five times three rows.

05:19.680 --> 05:23.120
That is five times three is 15.

05:23.120 --> 05:27.320
And then we get 16, 17, 18, 19 okay.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.840
And then the first number is one and the last number is six.

05:32.040 --> 05:37.160
So I think you can probably already guess what Lin space does.

05:37.440 --> 05:44.800
It creates a vector of linearly spaced numbers between 1 and 6.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.160
And how many numbers do we get between this input and this input.

05:49.160 --> 05:55.760
Well we get whatever is specified by the third input, which in this case is 19.

05:56.280 --> 06:01.240
So there you go 19 linearly spaced numbers between 1 and 6.

06:02.200 --> 06:07.880
So let's create an output for this I will call this a is not a very informative variable name.

06:07.880 --> 06:08.480
But that's okay.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.640
We don't need it very long.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.080
And let's see what is the type of this variable.

06:13.680 --> 06:13.960
Huh.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.400
So this is a numpy array okay.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.600
What is an ndarray.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.360
This is actually two separate words here.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.730
This is a n for n dimensional.

06:24.930 --> 06:26.690
And then this is array.

06:26.930 --> 06:32.410
So an array in Python just means that it's more than one number.

06:32.490 --> 06:34.890
So if there's one number you might call it a scalar.

06:34.890 --> 06:36.730
If you're familiar with linear algebra.

06:37.090 --> 06:41.730
And an array would be a vector or a matrix.

06:41.890 --> 06:48.650
So in NumPy if you have a set of numbers kind of like a list, but a numpy version of a list, we call

06:48.650 --> 06:49.650
that an array.

06:49.970 --> 06:53.330
And then there's different dimensionalities of arrays.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.730
You'll learn about that later.

06:54.730 --> 06:56.050
You don't have to worry about that now.

06:56.290 --> 07:02.290
So an n dimensional array that is a specific type of variable in numpy.

07:02.290 --> 07:03.450
And that you see here as well.

07:03.450 --> 07:04.850
This is called an array.

07:06.010 --> 07:11.930
So that is different from the type of a list which is of type list.

07:11.970 --> 07:21.250
Now sometimes in numpy you can actually enter non numpy arrays into a numpy function.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.290
So here I'm inputting a list.

07:23.290 --> 07:25.180
This is not a numpy data type.

07:25.180 --> 07:26.420
This is a list.

07:26.780 --> 07:32.500
Inputting that into the numpy function and I get a valid result.

07:32.980 --> 07:39.820
There are situations where the input into a numpy function needs to be a numpy array.

07:39.980 --> 07:43.820
So how do we convert a list into a numpy array?

07:44.140 --> 07:46.020
That's actually pretty straightforward.

07:46.020 --> 07:49.260
We use a function called numpy dot array.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.860
Okay so here let me put some spaces in here.

07:53.100 --> 08:00.020
So this is a list here I'm inputting the list into this function numpy dot array.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.860
And what does this function do.

08:01.900 --> 08:06.420
It takes in something that is not a numpy array like a list.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.660
And it outputs something that is a numpy array.

08:09.860 --> 08:11.860
So now I can run this code.

08:11.860 --> 08:16.820
And we see that this transformed from a list into a numpy array.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.420
And what does this actually look like.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.660
Well it doesn't look that interesting.

08:20.900 --> 08:28.520
Uh, it's basically all the same information just encased in this type array instead of a type list.

08:29.320 --> 08:34.840
Another numpy function that I can introduce you to now is a range.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.960
So I have mentioned this variable type called range.

08:40.160 --> 08:44.720
Now we haven't yet used range a whole lot except for you know this is what we did here.

08:44.720 --> 08:52.120
We made a list of integers from 0 to 1 minus whatever this number is here.

08:52.520 --> 08:52.800
Okay.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.800
So this is a base Python type.

08:56.040 --> 09:01.480
And now there's a numpy version of this which is a range or array range.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.800
That's what the A stands for.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.640
So let's see if I do.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.000
If I run this I see something that looks similar to this.

09:08.640 --> 09:12.520
The output of this line, except the output of this line was list of course.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.760
And the output of this line is a numpy array.

09:16.760 --> 09:20.720
And from here you can index just like you have learned how to index before.

09:21.320 --> 09:21.560
Okay.

09:21.600 --> 09:29.400
Now another thing that something potential point of confusion that I would like to point out here is

09:29.920 --> 09:30.850
this Here.

09:30.850 --> 09:36.370
The output of Linspace started at one and ended at six.

09:36.370 --> 09:39.770
So this is an inclusive upper bound here.

09:39.770 --> 09:45.450
That means the output will actually include the number that I have specified here.

09:46.010 --> 09:55.690
On the other hand numpy dot arange starts counting at zero and it stops at one less than this value

09:55.730 --> 09:56.130
here.

09:56.130 --> 09:58.890
So this is an exclusive upper bound.

10:00.010 --> 10:00.330
Yeah.

10:00.330 --> 10:06.050
So that's confusing because sometimes these functions have inclusive upper bounds and sometimes they

10:06.050 --> 10:08.210
have exclusive upper bounds.

10:08.690 --> 10:14.930
As you work with Python more and more you will start to learn which functions are inclusive and which

10:14.970 --> 10:15.970
are exclusive.

10:16.130 --> 10:22.570
You'll also start to build intuition for when a function might be inclusive and when it might be exclusive.

10:23.730 --> 10:25.890
For now, don't stress about that.

10:25.930 --> 10:31.370
You can just test out these functions as you need to use them to make sure that they are giving the

10:31.370 --> 10:33.010
output that you expect.
